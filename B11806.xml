            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>ERY REVEREND AND VERTVOVS</hi> Mother, hauing a purpose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vsual maner of others, who publish any treatise, to present it to the gracefull acceptaunce of some qualifyed person, I haue made choice of you for a Patronesse of this booke, whoe haue engaged your selfe by the bands of the same holy religion, to render all due honour, and respect to these noble persons, who haue borne the standard of the Crosse, soe coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
<pb facs="tcp:176965:3"/> vnder the colours of S Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. And indeed your life, &amp; the liues of your vertuous sisters, are framed &amp; instituted according to the same rule, and in some things (be it spoken to Gods glory, and the cōfortable hope of your reward, if yee perseuere in wel doing) notwithstanding the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and tendernes of your sexe, yee goe beyond them in embracing the crosse by mortifications, and austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For besides the wearing of haire-cloth, sharpe disciplines, frequēt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, dayly mentall and vocall prayers, lying vpon a cold and hard strawbed, without stripping your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of your course and poore cloths yee weare, rising at midnight to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins which things are cōmon to you both, yee doe alsoe obserue perpetual abstinence from flesh, and eate but
<pb facs="tcp:176965:3"/> one poore meale in a daye, and beside yee are allwayes murd vp within the foure walles of your monastery. To which obseruations Capucins are not obliged for iust causes, for that their labour in studies, their preaching, &amp; instructing of others, can not subsist with them.</p>
                  <p>And because among you, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part is sprōg from noble &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall houses in our country, I doubt not but the view &amp; consideration of their noble persons, will prouoke you to goe forward in your holy vocatiō, without the least faynting; which I speake, not as doubting at your reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and strength giuen to you by him, whoe spake by the mouth of his Prophet for assurāce of such as ye are. <hi>Esaiae.</hi> 40.31. <hi>Children shall faint and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp; youngmen shall fall by infirmitie.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:176965:4"/> But they that hope in our Lord, shal chaunge their strength. They <hi>shall take winges as eagles.</hi> They <hi>shall run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and not labour, they shall walke, and not faynt.</hi> Yet good examples of those whom yee affect more then your owne naturall brethren (for the bonds of grace doe tye faster in loue then the bands of nature) serue for an incitement, and encouragement to you in going on well, in despite of all sinistre suggestion of him whoe see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to supplant all those that runne as yee doe, that yee may obtaine such an incorruptible crowne. And if the examples of your owne sexe preuaile more with you, I knowe yee are well stored with them, soe that it should be vnnecessarie to put you in mind of them otherwise, then by a blessed cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratiō of them. I will only point at the first noble Dames from whom
<pb facs="tcp:176965:4"/> you deriue your selues by true descēt. Was not the blessed mother of God, the great Lady and mistresse, of that holy vow of virginitie which yee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke? whoe as S. Aug. noteth, euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prooued it by her aunswere made vnto the Angel, bringing her the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of conceauing the Sonne of God. Which was: <hi>How shall this be done because I knowe not man? Luc.</hi> 1.34. For she wold not haue asked such a question how a woman should beare a sonne promised to her, if she had marryed meaning to haue carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. <hi>S. Aug. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>de virg.</hi> Next in holy scripture, thoughe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse Anne was not a virgin, yet she liued after her husbands death in the state of holy widow hood, and true deuout chastitie, and <hi>departed not from the temple by fasting, &amp; prayers
<pb facs="tcp:176965:5"/> seruing night and daye: Luc.</hi> 2.37. whoe was a liuely paterne of that life which yee professe, in that yee dwell conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie in Gods house, praying night and day, and offering your prayers accompanied with cōtinual fastings.</p>
                  <p>Now because the thrice blessed Virgin, and the prophetesse Anne, did liue single, and sequestred from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companie (for in the beginning of regeneration, as in the beginnings of humane generation, there was no multitude to be found) yet within few yeares after, there was a conuent <hi>of holy Virgins to be found, of whom the scripture maketh mention:</hi> soe that your conuentuall life, hath sprong from the pure fountaine of Gods word (which I note by the way, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of those that are afrayd without cause of traditions of the
<pb facs="tcp:176965:5"/> church of God) and hath bene euer since deduced to this age. Doe we not read that Philipp the Eāugelist (that is a preacher as S. Paul also writeth to Timothie. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.9. Doe the worke of an Euangelist) <hi>had foure daughters Virgins in his house, which did prophecie?</hi> In wich foure virgins, were consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first fruits of deuout Virgins. Vpon which place <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> that graue and learned patron of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie noteth, that this was in Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea. <hi>In qua ex gentibus Ecclesia per centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionem Cornelium fuerat dedicata, etiam virginum puellarum praeberet exempla. Hieron. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cont. Iouin.</hi> That Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea in which place the church was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by the centurion Cornelius, might also yeeld examples of maydē Virgins. As thoughe he wold haue sayd, which he speaketh in an other
<pb facs="tcp:176965:6"/> place in the same booke that it was a thing most requisit, that <hi>Monile Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae talibus gemmis decoraretur,</hi> that the chaine which the spouse of Christ doth weare, should be adorned with such gemmes, and pearles.</p>
                  <p>Heerin certes our poore countrie hath great cause of comfort, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yee, and other virgins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders of relig on (for the Queene, which is the church, in golden rayment is compassed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:176965:6"/> your houses shine as though they were of yuorie, &amp; becoming daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the king of kings, yee haue delighted him in the honour yee giue him. Which is by lifting vp pure harts and hands continuallie to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And now although there be a chaos of sea betweene you and your deare countrye, yet is it not such as was betweene Abraham, and the rich man in the Gospel: and therfore yee must perseuere in all patience, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. <hi>Donec misereatur Deus,</hi> till God take pitie of vs. For albeit God (whose iudgements are vnsercheable) doth remooue farre from our eyes any great hope of raising the walles of Sion, in that manner as they stand and flourish in Catholique contries, yet cease not yee to importune him with your holy prayers, and hope
<pb facs="tcp:176965:7"/> against hope, knowing that God is able to rayse vp children to Abraham out of verie stones, and persuade your selues, that your prayers shall not returne emptye. Sing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid. <hi>Turne our captiuitie o Lord as a torrent in the south. Psalm.</hi> 125.4. and doubt not but after your sowing in teares, yee shall reape in ioyfulnes. Howsoeuer yee goe weeping, and casting seeds, yet in the end shal yee come forth with exultation, carying your sheaues, at the least into that heauenlie barne, where pure wheate is seuered from all chaffe, and drosse.

This matter is soe worthy due consideration, that I doe earnestly beseech, those whoe are morall men among our countrimen, and loue vertue, and goodnes out of the inclination of good nature, and perswade themselues that they haue a perfect hate, and detestation of vice, to examine this point betwene God, and their owne soule, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as they can, by commending themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to God in simplicitie of hart for this end, to knowe the truth, to examine, I saie whether Catholique religion hath not better precepts and rules wherby to order our life in the feare of God, and loue of our neighbour, then theirs hath.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:176965:9"/>
                  <p>For the first I knowe some Protestants will make noe question but boldly affirme it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie those whoe doe not well reflect vpon the rule of their owne faith, and will not take time to examine the precepts of Catholike religion, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a passionate preiudice against it, which is alsoe strengthened by their nurture and long custome. And to doe them noe wrong in speaking this in generall termes, where there may be fraude and calumniation sequested without more expresse specifying, I will descend to a more particular paralleling, and comparing of the one with the other, and touch it breifly in 2. or 3. points. First the Protestāts teach <hi>(a)</hi> that faith only doth iustifie, and that good workes haue noe part in iustification. A principle most pernicious, and not only opposite to the expresse words of holy scripture which saith. <hi>Doe you see that by workes a man is iustified and not by faith only?</hi> But in his owne nature ouerthrowing good workes, and breeding a dul drowsines in those that haue this disease in their braine, that they need not waken and rouze themselues vp to doe any such workes which are not better prized, and valued in the presence of God, to whose honour &amp; glory they be principally directed. Neither is it any meruaile if their faith which is a <hi>sick mans dreame,</hi> doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish awaie into nothing, it being but a conceited application of the iustice of Christ grounded vpon their mere frothy imaginatiō: soe that when they come to wake out of this dreame either by Gods
<pb facs="tcp:176965:10"/> mercy in awayting them in this world, or ouer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them by his iudgement in the next, they be like to the rich men of whom the Prophet Dauid speaketh. <hi>Dormierunt somnum suum &amp; nihil inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The secōd principle is, (b) that euery one which hath this beleife, and apprehendeth the iustice of Christ as his owne, is certainly saued, and he is bound to beleiue it as vndoubtedly that he is one of Gods elect, as he doth beleiue Christ to be God, and to raigne in glory with his Father.

I should neuer make an end, if I should recite the many dangerous gaps, which are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all vice and sinne by their doctrine; As that which they hold also for a fundamentall point, to wit, that it is (c) impossible to keepe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and consequently noe obligation is imposed vpon them for that end: that (d) al good
<pb facs="tcp:176965:10"/> workes are in thēselues sinnes, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed frō Gods grace as the fountaine, &amp; soe must be odious in themselues, &amp; abominable to God. <hi>(b) Bucerus in Colloq.

                  <p>The Catholique doctrine teacheth vs an other path, which though it be more narrowe, and straight as the way to heauen is, yet is it a direct and certaine truth: for it instructeth vs that good workes must necessarily accompanie faith, that doing good workes in purity of a good conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, we maie haue a great and comfortable hope of attayning heauen, that being strengthened with Gods grace, we are able to keepe Gods holy commandements, and that by the vnction of his holy spirit this burden is made light, &amp; this yoke sweete: that good workes are soe farre from being odious in his sight, that they are meritorious and shall be rewarded which that, <hi>euge serue bone quia in pauca fuisti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

There are many Catholique bookes which doe treat most amply these destructiue points of
<pb facs="tcp:176965:11"/> our Aduersaries doctrine, not only repugnant to supernaturall light of truth reuealed to vs, but alsoe to the light of naturall reason, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be dimme and weake in comparison of the supernatural, yet hath it nothing directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrarie or opposite to it. For what is more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, then that God which is the fountaine of all goodnes, &amp; illuminateth euery one which cometh into the world, and hath made man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this owne image and likenes in his soule, and free will, and endowed him with his grace purchased by his sons merits after, he had deliuered him out of the hands of his enemy, to whom he had made himselfe captiue by sinne, should notwithstanding leaue him so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and infested, that he should sinne mortally in all his best workes, and that all his pious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, and trauailes, all mortifications of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, acts of charitie, chastitie, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and other Christian vertues, should haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in themselues, but the corruption of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie poison.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but these things sound soe harsh in the eares of any indifferent man, that he will hardly beleiue them at the first, till he reade, and see the bookes of his owne Rabbins, which stoutely defend these horrible paradoxes.</p>
                  <p>And nowe will I descend to the liues of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, by which the former point is alsoe prooued, that Catholique religion is the true naturall, and noursing mother of good life.
<pb facs="tcp:176965:11"/> These are they whoe haue entered into a more straight waye of perfection, and therfore, when their liues are aunsuerable to their profession (as God be thanked there is a great multitude of such) are much honoured and respected by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, whoe by vertue of this approbation are alsoe made fellowe members with them, and participant of their prayers, and merits. But to proceed with our aduersaries, and to manifest yet more their hate to pietie and vertue, Doe they not I pray you, scornefully reiect, and condemne this maner of life as superstitious? Doe they not labour to make it odious, and abominable? Therfore that it may not seeme so hydeous in these blessed men, that I my make their accesse more easie euen among these which would crye them downe with loude hooting, giue me leaue to present to thy eyes (deare Reader) their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed predecessours, whom the holy booke of God hath marked out, and left vs their memorie as worthy to be enrolled and registred to all ages. <hi>Num.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 2. 3. To beginne with the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, whose vowes in obseruing certain thinges not commaunded were esteemed most holy, and acceptable in Gods sight, of whom some segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated themselues from the ordinarie state of people for a tyme, and to be limited by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselues, some were perpetual as Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. What doe Nazarites signifie as S. Gregory, well noteth in his 33. booke of his morals, and the 23. chapter? <hi>But those that voluntarily absteyne
<pb facs="tcp:176965:12"/> from things otherwise lawefull,</hi> as from eating flesh eather for certaine daye and times, or altogether, from marriage, from propriety in worldly goods, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Are not these alsoe directly intimated in the 33. of Deuteronomie, where the perfection and doctrine of the holy man of Leui is described. <hi>He that sayd to his father and mother, I know you not,</hi> and to his brethren I knowe you not, and they knowe not their children, these kept thy word, obserued thy couenant, thy iudgements o Jacob, and thy lawe o Israel, they shall putt <hi>incense in thy furie, and Holocaust vpon thine altar.</hi> And the Prophet Dauid. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 11. alludeth heerunto by waye of exhortation to this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Audi filia &amp;c.</hi> Heare o daughter, and encline thyne eare, and forget thy fathers house.</p>
                  <p>May we not say truly that Helias, Helisaeus, and S. Iohn Baptist ledd this kind of life, and were for it reputed of eminent sanctitie, and pietie? The children of the prophets are styled by S. Hierome, the monkes of the old testament. <hi>Filij prophetarum quos monachos in veteri testamento legimus &amp;c. S.

                  <p>The strict liues of these holy men haue caused such an hartburning in the first newe Gospellers that they sought all wayes possible, and vsed all
<pb facs="tcp:176965:12"/> the shifts they could inuent to disguise this truth. It would be too long to insist much heerin, I will only point at their expositions vpon the first chapter of S. Marke, and the third of S. Mathew where S. Iohns holines of life is cōmēded by the Euangelists and for proofe of it, his hard, and roughe garments of camels haire, and his poore foode of locusts, and wild hony is represented by them. Some of their newe glossers will needes haue men beleiue, that this sort of garment, was but such as poore countrie men wore, and some others that it was a fine kind of garment which we call chamblett, which may become a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister more then of an ordinary ranke to weare. <hi>Naratus in sua catena.

                  <p>Howe often doth the holy scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the putting on of sackcloth, as a worke of penaunce, wherby Gods wrath against sinne is appeased?

                     <item>2. By reason of the matter, and contents of it. For it doth not teach any other thing, then Apostolicall, and Euangelical life, soe that it is an imitation of the life of Iesus Christ, and of his Apostles, not only to preach, but alsoe in the manner of preaching the Gospel.</item>
                     <item>3. By the approbation made miraculously by holy Fathers by infinite declarations, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the cheife Pastours and Bishops, &amp; likewise generall councels, whoe haue soe highly esteemed this rule, that they haue taken the paynes to explicat it as it is written at lenght. Which is not common to any other rule.</item>

                     <item>7. By reason of the great multitude of those whoe embrace this rule. For at this time only S. Frauncis seemeth to haue more houses, and more soldiours, whoe serue vnder his banner, then all other orders together.</item>
                     <item>8. By reason of the simplicitie of the style. For euen as the aunciēt Fathers doe proue the truth of the holy scripture by the lowlinesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the style: soe we may produce this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration in this rule which is composed in soe plaine a style, soe naturall, and conformable to the Apostolicall style, and soe farre from curious words or humane prudence, that those whoe reade it most saye. <hi>This is the finger of God.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no small honor, emong men, to be nobly borne, but yet it is farr more eminent in the presence of god, when it is accompanied, with true vertue. Manie there ar who shine in the one, not with out great glorie and applause: but few of thē attaine to the perfectiō of the other.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176965:18"/> And yet notwithstanding this worldlie and transitorie glorie, in comparison of immortall (wherwith the blessed sowles ar glorified) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth rather to be reputed a dreame, or a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, then anie real qualitie. For it dependeth meerly vpon the opinion of mortall men, and so consequentlie quicklie dyeth, and fadeth: when solid vertue whose perfectiō (if it could be seen with corporall eyes) would rauish men with her eminent beautie, and doth in deed crowne them that embrace her, with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lawrels, which liue and floorish, for al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in Paradise. For god (who of his infinite goodnes, hath made vs heires of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet so that we make purchase of it by our workes, as our blessed sauiour hath bought it with the price of his blood) doth not regard bare titles without effects. For in deed the more eminent men are, and mounted aboue the commen and ordinarie rank: so much the more ar they bownd to excell others: and to mantaine their dignities, by the extraordinarie practise, of the heroical vertues of the Crosse. So that their examples, may serue to guide and conduct others, ouer whome they ar sett (for that is gods holie ordinance): and so dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their duetie, they may auoyd the dangers of those dreadfull threats, which god denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the great ones of this world: The mightie shall suffer mightie torments. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176965:18"/> blessed father Angel of Ioyeuse, as admirable in the one, as imitable in the other, both in the world, and in religion, knew so well to ioyne vertue with nobilitie, and so to beare hymself, that he enobled hym self, with mainteining this happie match of the one with the other. Touching his noble descent it is well knowen, that the most honorable and noble familie of Ioyeuse (from which he discended) hath been and is, one of the most ancient, and most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious families, not onelie of Languedock, but of all France: out of which ar come manie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthie persons, whose vertues and memorable exployts, ar eternised by happie demonstrance of the effects and witnessed by monuments, to the view of the worlde. The Hydres or water-Adders which they beare for their armes, subdewed by their first progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; haue serued to incite their posteritie, to braue aduentures, when they were to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the defence of the Churche or the state. And for euident proofe hereof the most christian kings (whom god hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the title and graces of the eldest, and first borne sonnes of the church) haue giuen testimonie of their valeur, and worthe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring vnto them titles and honours due one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to eminent vertues. For owt of this howse ar discēded Maisters of the Campe, Marshalls, Admiralles, Dukes, and Peeres of France. So
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176965:19"/> that it may be rightlie called, a temple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, built vpon a firme foundation of vertue, and prowesse. Which consideration hath moued the princes of bloode in France, and the most princely familie of Lorraine, to search after this familie and honour it which their alliance.</p>
                     <p>During the raigne of Lewis the eleuenth, Lewis Ioyeuse married Iane de Bourbon, which marriage caused great publick ioye: which it pleased god also to blesse, with happie and fruictfull issew, of the Counts of Chartres, and Boneual, (who sprung from them). Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Anne Ioyeuse, Admirall, Duke, and Peere of France, married Margaret of Lorrain (sister of Lewis of Lorraine, wyse of Henry the third). And in our tyme, Henriette Ioyeuse, daughter of Hēry Ioyeuse, Count of Bouchage (who was the blessed father Angel of whom we treate) was married to Henry of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, Duke of Montpensier (one of the most noble grafts that euer came from that royall familie of S. Lewis): And after his deathe (for he dyed in the verie flower of his age) she was married to Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, who had by her, a noble and happie issew, of such towardnes, that they doe now in the blade of their tender infancie, giue great hope of extraordinarie vertue in more perfect age, when they shall know, how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176965:19"/> them, to follow the example of their grand-father (this blessed fa. Angel) and not to degenerate, from that noble stock of Guise, from whence they ar come: which hath bene renoumed for manie noble triumphes had ouer the saracens, for the honour of the crosse of Christ: and hath bene since for manie ages, as it were the sword, and boucler of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick saith, in subdewing rebellious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted miscreants: and reducing them to the obedience of their holie mother, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, Apostolique, Roman church: Out of which there is no faithe, no pietie, no religion, no charitie, no grace, no merit, and consequēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie no saluation; It being therfor euident, that this familie, is singularlie adorned with these great alliances, yet not with standing it is made more famous, by the actions of heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which as litle bright fires, affixed to a heauenlie globe, haue so beautified the soule of blessed father Angel, that his lyfe hath bene as a wonder of rare perfection, euen in the iudgement of most wise, and iudicious behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therof.</p>
                     <p>He was the sonne of William Ioyeuse, a man of singular pietie, and great courage: who was honoured by Henry the second, in admitting hym to his order of knighthood: and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished hym Lieutenant in Languedoc: wher- he executed that charge, with so great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176965:20"/> and moderation, for the space of fiue and thirtie yeares; that for acknowledgment of his merites, he was made Marshall of Frāce by Henry the Third.</p>
                     <p>His mother was Marie of Batarnay, a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of so rare pietie, and example of good lyfe: that it may well be thought, that God (who doth often blesse the children, for theyr parents sake) did powre the torrent of his benedictions vpon her children, for her sake. And albeit there haue bene manie excellent and most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous dames, which haue eyther discended of this house, or bene allied to yt: yet she was, as it were a mirroir in represēting them all; &amp; had none of those good qualities wanting, which anie in particular, or all in generall had in them of worthie remarke.</p>
                     <p>She was called the mother of the poore, hauing merited reallie, that happie title: she did often visite prisons, and hospitalls; and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily charitable to those shamefast poore, who were in great necessitie, and yet did not publiquelie begg reliefe, of which sort of poore, there is great quantitie.</p>
                     <p>Her affections were wholie bent to deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō, and her thoughts were not fastned to anie earthlie things, but all waies raysed towards heauen. She was free from all spott of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hauing an auersion from the Court, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with all contentement in Languedock,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176965:20"/> with her husband, not withowt singular edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the whole prouince by the lustre of her example.</p>
                     <p>And for the Court, she had wholie abādoned all memorie, as she did all affection of it: had she not bene forced to liue some yeares ther, partlie to satisfie the desires of that pious &amp; religious Quene, Lowise of Lorraine: and partlie to take charge of her children, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then in great honour and esteeme, were to be gouerned and guided, by her presence, least the feruour of their age might transport them, to doe other wise, then was hopefullie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of them in their infancie.

                     <p>This deuout and honorable dame, being thus enforced to endure the absence of her husband (whome next to god, she loued &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored most dearely): making her profit of this losse, augmented dailie, the practise of her deuotions, and mortifications, and gaue her self to all sweet entertainement, in her frequēt and feruent prayers, &amp; soliloquies: and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176965:21"/> her self, with spending the daye therin: she made the night serue for this entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a more propre tyme, euen for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eares of the sowle, to receaue in trew si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, what god also would speak vnto her, The long nights, passed in this manner, often seemed to her but short, and whē sleepe seazed vpon her (which is necessarie for sustaining the frayle bodie) she took it in a chayre, not in bed: so as after she had slumbered a whyle, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her holie and pious meditation, till the breaking of the daye. And then she accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed her self, to make her first visite in the churche, where she powred owt her sowle in such ardour of deuotion, that the effects doe witnes it, by the heauenlie benediction, wher with god did reward her, in that her example kindled deuotion, in other noble dames, and obtained manie graces of god, for her self, her children, and in deed the whole realme. And hereof this is no small testimonie, that vpon the daye of the marriage, of her sonne the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, when as the king, and the whole court were occupied, in banquetting, tilting, and courtlie triumphes of ioye, to showe how they reioyced in this marriage: She retyred her self, &amp; shutt vp her self in her Oratorie, praying with manie teares &amp; inward grones, that theyre excesses and superfluities might not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke god to punish her children.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:176965:21"/>
                     <p>This deuout Ladie, hauing spent all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, in the churche, (where wear principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to lift vp owr hartes &amp; hands to god) she disposed of her self in the afternoone, to attend in the court: employing her selfe wholie in good workes conformable to her charitie &amp; humilitie, &amp; to make benefitt of those occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which might offer them selfes, to doe good. After her trauaile (which was able to wearie, and weare owt a strong bodie) her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary food was, brown bread, with biefe, or some other more grosse, and common meat: so that she was neuer seen, to touch those meats which are more fyne and delicate (although her table according to her qualitie, was euer furnished with the best): refusing those meats by extraordinarie abstinence and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which she (being vehemently amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of god) did charitablie distribute, to the poore, who ar his members. She fasted all fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, throughout the yeare: and kept precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the fast of lent: &amp; likewise from Allhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowtyde to christenmas, she fasted with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie austeritie. And emong her vertuous actions, one is verie remarkeable, that on that daye, that she was by her friends promised in marriage: assoone as she hard of it, she prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her self before her parents, and not with owt shedding manie teares, besought them to giue her leaue, to enter into religiō, (such loue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176965:22"/> &amp; affection had she to serue god, in the state of virginal puritie). I will not dilate my self, by speaking of the noble progenie of this familie of Batarnay: It shall suffice to knowe, that it is a most ancient and noble howse, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume and esteeme, in Tourain, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou, whence are come, the Counts of Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chage.</p>
                     <p>The noble person, William of Ioyeuse, hauing espoused Madame Marie of Batarnay, had by her seauen children (wherof some came to perfect age, and made their nobilitie, and valour appeare to the view of the world &amp; so wonne the harts of manie, by their worth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

The eldest brother was called Annas de Ioyeuse, who when he was at ripe age, was made Admiral, Duke, and Peere of France, Gouernour, &amp; Lieutenant General for the king in Normandie. These honours engaged hym, to doe noble seruices, so that seruing his prince and Countrie in the siege of Fere, he was wounded in the mouthe by a harquebuse, &amp; lost two of his teethe. He took manie townes, with his forces which he commaunded, in Auuergne: where he had so happie successe that for his valour &amp; prudence, Henry the third
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:176965:22"/> made choyce of hym, to stand in the breache against Henry the fourth then king of Nauarre (who made all Guienne, to tremble for feare of so potent an enemie, as after he made hym self redoubted thorough the world, hauing put hym self into the bosomme of the churche, &amp; acknowledged her for his mother) So there was no other thyng but the cawse of religion, &amp; the seruice of his king, which pushed hym against so mightie an enemie. Wherin, yf the successe was not answearable to the desire and hope of the state (God in his prouidence hauing other wise disposed of yt, for secret cawses vnknowen to vs) yet was there wanting no courage or valour of his parte, as his exployts manifested, in that battel principallie, at Moth S. Eloy, where so manie enemies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated: though, that irreperable disaster fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed shortlie after, in the battell of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras: Where a soudain feare surprising his armie, they brake theyr order, and while his soldiers, were preparing themselfs to flight, he cast hym self into the midest of his enemies, thinking therby to oblige them to followe hym: And there sacrificed his lyfe, with manie other gallant gentlemen, for the seruice of his prince, and the defence of the Catholick, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique, and Roman churche.</p>
                     <p>The secōd brother was Francis Ioyeuse, the most illustrious Cardinal, whose noble and pio{us}

After his entrie into religion, he took the name of Father Angel Ioyeuse, whose lyfe, and actions I haue vndertaken to wryte in this treatise; and to expose it, as a burning light, bothe for religious, and for seculats who certainly cōformed his lyfe according to his name, and was an angel in his discourse, in his zeale, in his exhortation, and in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, for the greater edification of many others.</p>
                     <p>The fourth sonne, or branche of this noble stock, was Scipio Ioyeuse, who after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of his father, was a liuelie and trew image of hym in valour and courage, which he shewed for the defence of the churche, and state: and succeeded hym, in his charge of the Lieutenantship of Lāguedoc. He had manie noble cōquests, and palmes of Victories in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers battells: and in the end at the siege of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemur, where great forces comming for reskue of the besieged, and forcing hym to raise his siege, he hym self brake the bridge of barkes and botes, which were made by the enemies, to cutt of all meanes for the enemie to recoyle: and putt hym self in Vantgard of his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, with his pike in his hand, till he receaued two woundes, in this noble attempt, &amp; so fell into the riuer and yielded vp his lyfe. Whose bodie was not recouered from the enemies,

                     <p>The fift of the sonnes, was Claude Ioyeuse, who was Marques of S. Sauueur, who at the age of fifteen yeares, lost his lyfe with his eldest brother, at the battel of Coutras. Thus we see, the nobilitie, and eminencie of the familie, whence he discended: who was as a Phoenix dead to the world, burnt in the odoriserous spices of his holie vowes, and hyding his lyfe with Iesus Christ, with in a litle cell of retraict, and a lodging place, peculiar to god, (for so he was wont to saye to his brethren, to sweeten the yoke of religion:) deseruing eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and renoume, in that he made so happie a marriage and true concord, betweene two things, which seeme so contrarie (although in deede, one dependeth vpon the other) that is betwen the excellencie of Nobilitie, and the pouertie of Religion.</p>

                     <head>Of his birth and Education. THE SECOND CHAPTER,</head>
                     <p>THE blessed person was borne, in the yeare of our lord, 1563. Who afterward had his holie birth in baptisme, &amp; was presented to the holie font, by Monseigneur de Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency Conestable of Frāce; and there took the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176965:25"/> name of Henrie, which he changed for the name of Angel when he became religious. As soone, as he came into the world and was but a tender sucking infant, he gaue hopefull signes of those heauenlie graces, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afterward in his yowthe. When he grew to that age, that he was somewhat capable, of the seed of vertue and knowledg; his father being wise and prudent, had great care to prouide for hym, a vertuous and learned mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that his children might be trayned and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned well, bothe in vertue and good learning. Theyr maisters name was Monsieur Martin, a man of eminent knowledg, and exemplar lyfe. Whose labours were approoued by the good fruicts of those seeds he sowed. Nature is powrefull, in working of greate effects, but yet education preuaileth more, hauing force often to change and correct naturall imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and vices, and engraft sweet fruit, in a crabb stock. But when education dothe onelie help goodnes of nature, there followe then miraculous effects. Emong the rest, (being all of great towardenes), this fa. Angell, thoughe the yongest, was most forward, who began presentlie to comport hym self, farr aboue his childish age: as yf he would then begin to laye the foundation, of those solide vertues, which shined in hym afterward. Wherfor his maister admiring his forwardenes, tooke
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176965:25"/> some more particular care of hym, then of the rest: as in proposing more questions to hym, and more particular instructiōs now and then apart. And god who in his eternall prouidence and loue, dothe designe some to a more happie end, for his glorie, and theire Saluation, doth giue meanes and graces most fitt for that end. Which often causeth, that we not easilie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the reason of it, can hardlie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue, that there are such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie actions, proceeding from those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if we were not eyewitnesses of them our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                     <p>No man beheld and saw hym, being yet but yong, who did not think that his countenance promised some great matter. The inward beautie of his sowle, streamed forthe beames outwardly. He was neuer wearied in praying, and seruing god: he frequented the church verie deuoutlie, and heard masse with an extraordinarie feeling. In hearing of sermons, he was diligent to treasure vp the principall poynts, which were of most fruit and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. When he was but a child of seauen yeares of age, he went often to confession, and had so great griefe for his litle faults and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as if they had bene great enormities. In discerning of which faultes, he showed that he had much vnderstanding. He chose for his Confessor, the Reuerend Father Robert
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176965:26"/> de Rocqua, Guardian of the obseruant Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans, whose pietie and knouledg, was of great remarke. His parents took great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentement, in their sonnes deuotion, and thanked god for powring these blessings on hym: and requested his maister to foster and encourage hym, in all actes of pietie and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Herein they were vnlike to manie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who seeke to diuert their children, from anie such actions, as though they foreshowed some ill fortune to them: and herein become murderers of their childrens sowles, in loosing the raynes to them of licentions debauchednes and disorders.</p>
                     <p>It happened in the yeare of Iubily, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yong men borne of noble parents, wearied with the world, and reflecting seriouslie vpon true and eternall contentements, mooued by good and holie inspirations, took resolution to retyre them selfes into the desert of religion; and to serue god more feruentlie, and with more quiet &amp; repose. They put their resolutiō in practise instantlie, not suffering those good inspirations (after they were examined and found such) to coole, and so took the habit of the Cordeliers at Tolose. These examples, were great motiues to Father Angel, so that euen then, (being but nine yeares old) he showed an extraordinarie desyre and affectiō, to follow their stepps. He reuealed it to his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176965:26"/> confessor, who (as he was prudent in his actiōs) sought to diuert hym from these thoughts, least his parents might suspect hym, for infusing thē into his tender sowle: but yet was he inflamed so with this fyre, that his confessor could not quench it. O how powerfull and charming are the sweet baytes, wherby god doth draw our harts vnto hym!</p>
                     <p>The first desyres of religion took hold of this tender yong Impe, by the meanes of these examples, and were strenthned in hym, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting vpon those heauenly recompences, which Christ promiseth to those, who followe his steppes. But they were brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by occasion of a miraculous, and verie remarkable action. He being one daye in the librarie of the Cordeliers at Tolose, (which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie is esteemed one of the best in France) and takyng a booke at hazard into his handes, to occupie his spirit in reading some what: he soodainlie felt an inward motion in his soule, which seemed to be expressed with a voice saying to hym; See, if yow find your self di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed, to obserue willinglie that, which is in this book. Harkening to this voyce, he opened the booke, and the first words he fownd writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, were. The Rule and lyfe of the Friers Minours. Wherupon his sowle melted as it were with the sweet delights of so particuler a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ocation: &amp; his face was dyed presentlie with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176965:27"/> a Vermilion colour, in token of this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie motion, and heauenlie grace, wherof he esteemed hymselfe vnworthye.</p>
                     <p>Hauing now so inwardlie taken, and layd vp in his hart, this manner of Gods holie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hym: he vsed all possible care and caution, to hyde this from his brethren who were in companie with hym, and therfor gaue ouer to looke more in the book for the present, least the reading of it, might giue occasion of some suspition to them. But they were no sooner owt of the librarie, and gone home, but he seeketh owt his confessor, and imparteth this matter to hym, and presentlie renewing his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer importune request, humbly beseecheth hym, that he might be admitted into their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, sithence it was the will of god, that he should professe that lyfe. Father Rocqua was much perplexed hereat, and hardlie knew which waye to turne hym self. Therfor after he had dispatshed hym for the present, with hope of enioying these contentmēts, which he sought, he entereth into further consideration of so weightie a matter, and resolueth to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise his friendes and parēts of it; assuring them, that if it were the will of god, no attempts and practises of theirs, would preuayle against it. Vpon knowledg of it by Fa. Rocqua, they thought it expedient, to diuert him from these thoughts, by sending hym from Tolose, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176965:27"/> they showed hym, what difficulties he was to vndergoe: As that he must rise at midnight, go barefooted, lye verie hard (without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his clothes:) that he must weare no linnen: &amp; be obliged to strict obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his own will. And they told hym, he was too delicate, and too weake to support this yoke: and that he should liue with farr more contentment in the world. They added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, That hauing one brother alreadie dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the church; ther were none left for the support of their familie, but his eldest brother, and he. And to conclude, in their exhortations they signified to hym, that he was yet too younge to determine of anie such course, and that hereafter vpon riper age, and better iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if he were so minded) that they would permitt hym, to satisfie hym self. His parents were troubled hereat by reason they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended some secret instigation of hym to this, rather then a true vocation: which was to their great comfort, as his mother did witnesse afterward: persuading hym to perseuere cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlie in religion, when the deuil sett his strongest batteries against hym, to draw hym back to the world, which he had so nobly and piouslie abandonned, that the memorie of that act will neuer dye. But in vayne were all the persuasions of his friendes till they remooued hym, from Tolose, and sent hym with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176965:28"/> to Paris: Hoping that the change of place and conuersation, would also change his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For it is a thing almost impossible, that a yong tenderling should continew his good desyre, when the obiect is taken from hym, which first occasioned it.</p>
                     <p>Paris is one of the most famous, &amp; floorish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vniuersities in the world, for all sort of good artes and sciences, renoumed also for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of excellent wits and rare perfections. In this vniuersitie the colledg of Nauar is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and most famous, for the education of Kings, Princes and Cardinalls and the greatest part of the Bishops of France, who ar exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of pietie, and great ornaments of the church. In this Colledg was this yong plant set, as in a good, and fertile soyle.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur Guyon, Doctor indiuinitie and a student of this Colledg, was chosen to be maister to hym, and his brethren. He was a man of great note for learning, pietie, and his diligēce in framing and beautifying these yong noble witts, ouer which he was sett. In so much that this blessed father, being but thirten yeares of age, by his paynes and the happienes of his own witt, did compose so well, both in verse and prose, that manie would not beleeue it to be possible, that he could doe it in such māner, till they were e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This yong noble Impe, would neuer be idle,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176965:28"/> but spent euen those tymes, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for his recreation in some particuler good studies. It was held half a miracle, to see hym without a book in his hand. His compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, mooued by his example, did set hym be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes as a pattern of vertue, sweetnes, and diligence: he would lett no daye passe with owt hearing masse, and that with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deuotiō. He communicated euerie monthe: and with that feeling, that his sowle was a fierie furnace of true deuotiō and feruor, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by those exhalations of sighes, and aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which he had: and this was the maine and principall studie to which he bent hymself. Hauing layd all good foundatiō for more high and subtill speculations: he began at thirteen yeares of age, to enter into his course of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie. In which knowledg though there be manie difficulties, by reason of the obscuritie of the tearmes, and conceptions, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, strength of vnderstanding, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to comprehend it: yet by the benefit of his cleare naturall vnderstanding, he waded easily into yt, and quite thorough it. By this meanes he was formed and framed in his vnderstāding, to the right conceauing, of the most secret and hidden misteries of our beleefe: and in his will, better prepared, by the knowledg of morall vertues, to the practise of thē: for it is certain, as we must knowe that which is good before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176965:29"/> we loue yt: so the greater knowledg we haue of it, the more feruent we ar in the search of it. After he had ended his studies with great commendation, and euident proofe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his witt, he was driuen from his colledg to the court, by the order and appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his parents where although in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apparence he forsook his studies, yet he did not so leaue them, but that he retayned a true affection to them, hauing nothing more often in his discourse then learning, and in hart nothing more engrauen, then treu religiō: and yet not without great admiration he ioyned and leagued three things together, which seeme to be mainlie opposite, to wit, Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For euen in those court actions, which haue in them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie much vanitie, he shewed example of true pietie and deuotion, withowt anie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, but a most gratious decencie. He was adorned with all good parts, which are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable. He was courteous and affable to the meanest sort: sweete and gracious in his owt ward carriage: modest and graue in his actions: serious and prudent in his discours, valiant and couragious, in matters of execution: a sworn enemie of vanitie: a scourge of reuiling and rayling: a perfect hater of flaterie and ambitiō. To conclude he was a mirrour, of all christian and morall vertues, faithfull he was allwaies

His vertues and perfections wonne hym the grace of Henry the third: Who in witnes of his affection, made hym presentlie maister of his ward-robe. The princes fauor, which maketh men of yong yeares, more vaine and glorious, made hym more humble, seeking rather daylie to growe more in vertue, then greatenes of fortune. He would refuse no man, that sought accesse to hym, but when mēs suites were iust, &amp; full of equitie, he would hym self present their petitiōs to the king. Religious men, had a great support of hym, and he reputed it a great honour, to entertain them at his table.

It fell owt, by gods special prouidence, that this happie marriage was made, and accomplished, there was so incredible similitude of affections in this holy couple. For she was inflamed, with the same loue from heauen, that he was: and no lesse enemie to vanitie then he, reputing it the venime and poyson of great dames. As he in a manlie sort made no esteeme of exterior beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; so she contrarie to the dispositiō of her sexe, detested all paynting &amp; farding, as a thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the sight of god. He was emong yong noble courtiers, a man whom all beheld as an example to follow: and she was of no lesse emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, emong noble dames. And now they being ioyned and tyed, one to the other by the bands of holie wedlock, and knott of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall loue, seemed to haue but one hart in two bodies, or one sowle in two hartes: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the verie same affection to all goodnes, and the like detestation and hate of vice. It is one of the wise mans sayings, that riches and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions ar left in patrimonie by the parēts: but the gift of a modest and wise woeman, cometh from God onelie. And when she is knowen forsuch in the state of her virginitie, he giueth counsel to the parents, to marrie her with a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:176965:31"/> man of the same perfectiō, to the end that god may be the better serued by such a commixtiō. But the vertues of them bothe, did so shyne in the court, that they were had in such admiratiō, that the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

What should I speak of their particuler deuotions in their priuate cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets? Howres seemed to them, but momēts, when they entered into cōmoning with their owne hartes, and reflecting vpon their cōscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, sometymes they were absorpt by profound meditation of the prouidence of god, which dothe powerfullie and sweetlie conduct all things, by the diuersitie of so manie wills, to the exaltation of his glorie. An other whyle, they turned their thoughts from the vanitie of the world, where seing nothing but wynde and smoake, they beheld with astonishment, the blindenes of manie sowles, which build towres of theire hopes, vpon so weake a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Among other things they were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myndfull, of the shortenes of this lyfe, and the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:176965:31"/> diuers accidents, which as sworne enemies lye in wayte to take it from vs: and they discerned here clearlie, the infinite occasions of sinne, more in the court, rather thē in anie place, and such as are able to make the most warie goer to slipp. And lastlie to controll all charming tēptations, they considered oft the assurance of deathe, and the vncertaintie of the tyme, with the accounpt which must be rendered of our actions, when we ar to arriue at the port, and be disembarked out of the rotten vess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Out of these good medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it grew, that their communication, and ordinary speeche, was of God, of vertue, of good workes, and of heauen. The sweetenes therof so seasoned their sowles, that they neuer had speeche of the delightes of this world, but showed great disgust and disdaine of them. The sweetnes of these heauenlie meditations, is such that none can valew them in anie sort, without feeling some foretast of them here. These holie and blessed exercises caused them, one tyme, after some good discours, that they protested and plighted faithe one to an other, solemnlie, that the suruiuour would renounce the world, and enter into a cloyster: where pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the rest of the dayes in religious exercises, should offer also the sacrifice of holie vowes to god, and pray for the sowle of the departed.</p>
                     <p>Can it easilie be conceaued, what measure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176965:32"/> of graces, their blessed sowles receaued from heauē, or how sweet these odours were, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were (as it were) perfumed, by the sweet oytments of heauēlie vnction. For what a miracle is it, to see such aspirations, sent vp to heauen, by a couple of such yong noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, wherof the eldest was not yet, twentie two yeares of age. I know not whether from that tyme, they made not a vowe of chastitie, and did not liue afterward in cōtinencie. God onelie, who saw their affections knoweth it. For the more they endeauored a spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement in pietie in the presence of god, the more were they carefull to hyde it, from the eyes of others, speciallie of courtiers, where deuotion and pietie, ar styled by the name of conterfeit deuotion and hypocrisie. Theire home was a holie temple, and house of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō; they had a careful eye to the behauiour of their seruants, that they might not giue offence to anie, and that their talk should not be dissolute, according to the common fashion of those, that serue great persons.</p>

They could not endure anie dishonest or wantō speeche, neither such, as was anie waye iniurious to others; which sort of talk, is but too ryfe in the court: for such fruite dothe the perfect loue of god produce, that we will not onlie forbeare to offend god our selues, but also pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At this tyme, the Order of the Capuchines, began to be in great reputation, (as it is at this present) for the integritie of the rule of S. Francis which they doe obserue according to the rigour of the letter, euē as our Sauiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to S. Francis, when the religious on the montaine of S. Columbe, thought it to be austere and rigid, heard a voyce from heauen, which sayd, that it was from god, and that his wil was, that it should be obserued, according to the letter, without anie glosse. This order much reuerenced for the austeritie, and for the noueltie of the religious, which were but freshlie come into France, at the instance of the great Cardinal of Lorraine, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and great sufficiencie, were well knowen by that authoritie, which he bare in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel

Honore: where the bones of this blessed Father rest; the same Illustrious Cardinal, hauing giuen to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins before, a place for a conuent, at Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, neare to his castle; after this by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of gods holie spirit, (who hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of his churche, and of Religious) they so multiplied in France, that they ar spred all most thorough all places therof: and yet they would be more, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now it happened one daye, as the Count of Bouchage, comming from the towne, being in coache with the king (for the king seldome went with out hym): he saw by chance, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by diuine prouidence, two Cappucins, who passed by with their walletts vpon their backs, he fixed his eyes a long tyme vpon thē: and in the view of them felt extraordinarye inward motions of his sowle, and seemed to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176965:33"/> heare an inward voyce, saying. These ar they, whome I doe chearish with all affection. The king seing hym sad and pensiue soodainly, and his eyes still fixed vpon the religious, doubted least he might imprint thē in his hart, whome he beheld so intentiuelie, and sayd to hym. These ar the true followers of S. Francis, and doe obserue his rule, according to the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. It is true (answered the Count) and in this they ar twice happie, for they doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie avoyd the enticing baites of the world, and of ambition, &amp; vanitie, but they put them selfs into a state of more assurance, for obtayning that glorious heauenlie crowne: for as much as mortifijng and crucifijng their carnall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites here on earth, they suffer with their head Iesus Christ crucified, whose words ar deeds and can not fayle. This vnthought view of them, with other few wordes, did so inflame his affection, that he desired in his hart, that he might presentlie chainge his state of lyfe: and in stead of his coache, and rich cloathes, he could haue bene well content, presentlie to haue been on foote, with a wallet on his back. Vpon this presentlie he called to mynd, his first holie inspiration, and how god had spoken to hym, when he was but yong of age, in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie of Tolose, as is before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Hence it fell owt, that he fell into some ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of perplexitie, not knowing what to doe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176965:34"/> in such straights, as he was. For on the one syde, he now resolueth hym selfe, that this was the rule, wherin he should spend, and end his lyfe: and on the other syde, the bands of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his deare spowse, whome he loued most affectionatelie, could not permit hym, to take this course of lyfe so much wished for. But what should he doe in this case: for either he thought he must impart his mynd to his wyfe, (whome he loued more dearelie then hymself) and so inuyte her to shut her self vp in a cloyster: or els he must forsake her without taking his leaue, and communicating his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this he could not doe: for the same day, he proposed it to a Capuchin, vnder an other name and it was tould hym, that no man could leaue his wyfe, and become a religious man, vnlesse she likewise entered into religiō. Wherupon he determined to attend the holie will of god.</p>
                     <p>In the mean tyme he daylie augmented his workes of pietie: gaue hymself to mentall prayer with more feruor, frequented the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments more often, then he did before. And for the better effecting of this, he quitted his own lodging, and bought one nere to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins, to the end, he might better practise his good intentions, and enioye the conuersation of these good religious fathers, whome he res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and cherished as angels sent frō heauen,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176965:34"/> and had them as directors of his actions. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he did oftē assist them at midnight, while they song their mattins, and obteined by speciall priuiledg, to haue one of them for his ghostlye father, which was also granted to his wyfe. And who would haue thought, that this vertuous course of lyfe, should not haue bene, to his full contentement, keeping no doubt most religiouslie Gods commandemēts, and doeing so much good, by his rare example. But God whose secrets far surpasse the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our vnderstanding, would accomplish a greater work by hym, as we shall see in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of this narration.</p>
                     <p>While he gaue hym selfe to this vertuo{us} and holie course of lyfe: it pleased god to take from hym, his dearest spowse; whose decease so stroke his hart, that he grew dying to the world, as though he would also dye with her. She dyed being but 22. yeares of age, in the spring of her vertues, whome god took to hym, to make her partaker, of a more excellent &amp; permanent glorie: leauing her friends much sorrowful; but that they were comforted, by the fruits of her former pietie. She left one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daughter, eighten mōthes old, a true heyre of her vertues, who is now Madame the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Guise, whose prudence in worldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, and singuler pietie, and feruour in the trew seruice of God, is well knowen,

                     <p>THE Count of Bouchage, after the deathe of his dearest spowse, languishing with sorrow, that his eyes could fynd no kind of worldlie delight, neither would his hart affect or loue anie thing. His losse was so greate, that he would not entertaine anie earthlie hopes, to build on: which are as mooueable as quicksāds: but at the lēgth recollecting hymselfe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that all such strokes come from the hād of god, though we know not the cause of it, and the will of god therin. And therfor as the sonne when it appeareth, scattereth the thick foggie clowdes, which darkned the ayre: so did he chase the clowdes of this afflictiō, and cheared hym self by taking holie resolution, worthie of his noble spirit, &amp; gaue the cartell of defyance to fortune, &amp; all the mistie brouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie of the world, which depriue men of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, the trew light of the trew sonne of eternall glorie. He discerned those things trewlie in ther nakednes, and barenes, which worldlings beholding with a fayre glasse, doe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176965:35"/> so much desyre and admire. In so much that often tymes, he compared the world with the greate priest Hely, who sent back Samuel; when as he being called by the voyce of God, ranne to Hely. And it wil not be amisse to sett downe his verie wordes, as they were written with his owne hand, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this my discourse, is fownded vpon the truthe.</p>
                     <p>The world (saith he) as an other Hely, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs from it, when we ar put back of these verie creatures, which we tender &amp; which we loue, fynding in them a thowsand disgusts, infidelities, instabilities and defects. Our friends forsake vs, our seruants mock vs, our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niōs betraye vs, and in the midst of all pleasures and delights, we fynd infinite sorrowes, and bitter gripings. What is this els, but to make vs knowe, that the world to which we runne doth reiect vs, and giue vs manie skornes, and sharpe blowes. And what dothe it saye, but get the gone, I am not thy God: Get the gone, the good and that contentment thou seekest, is not to be fownd in me. He spake heare in as a man of great experience and wisedome, to those, who being transported with the dallian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the smiling fortunes of the world, haue sworne a league, and alliance, with the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs, and prosperities of it.</p>
                     <p>This contempt of the world grew dailie in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176965:36"/> hym, as no doubt the light of grace did growe: yet could he not execute it, by reason of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encōbrances, which followed the death of his deare spowse, I mean the discharge of her last will, which he did verie faithfullie, &amp; the feare which he had of occasioning great discō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to his friends: &amp; incurring the kings displeasure, knowing how deare, and inward he was esteemed by hym. These consideratiōs &amp; manie others hindered hym, that he did not so speedilie accomplish his holie purpose, as he would. But god who laugheth at the counsells and dessignes of men, &amp; turneth them as it seemeth best to his holie wisedome, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of hym, in the end; and by the sweet gale of his holie spirite (which bringeth in a perfect calme, to afflicted &amp; trowbled sowles) made hym knowe his will, by an action ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie &amp; miraculous.</p>
                     <p>One daye being occupied in holie exercises of pietie and deuotion, according to his wont, falling into remembrance of his deare wyfe, and her excellent vertues, he could not forbear deepe groanes, which the anguish of his hart, drew from hym perforce: so that seeking to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease these inward troubles, he took his Howres, (which is his book of prayers, for so Catholiques call them) into his hands. At the first opening of his book, he fell vpō this verse, <hi>Dirupisti Domine vincula mea, tibi sacrificabo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176965:36"/> hostiam laudis:</hi> Thow hast broken my bands, o lord, I will sacrifice to the, the sacrifice of prayse. Pawsing a while vpon the wordes (for so deuoute sowles, who ar exercised in matters of deuotion, doe frequentlie), he began to think that these wordes did touch hym verie nearlie: as though god had expreslie spoken to hym &amp; sayd, God hath broken the bands of thy marriage, which did hinder the from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his stepps; therfor is it most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I now obeye the voyce of his holie inspiration, &amp; offer vp my self, as a sacrifice to hym, which is the best manner of prayer, which I can expresse. And as he was occupied in this holie thought, his book fell owt of his hand: he took it vp againe, and the same words again were the first that offered them to his sight, <hi>Thou haist broken my bands, O lord</hi> &amp;. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredlie saith he, this is god who speaketh. And againe being eleuated in mynd, and not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his book in his hands: he lett it fall the third tyme, &amp; yet againe fell vpon the same wordes, whervpon being astonished, he shut the book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, fell on his knees, &amp; bathing his eyes with manie teares, and opening his hart to god, he vsed these amorous wordes full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</p>
                     <p>O Almightie god, sauiour of the world, and most bounteous louer of thy creatures, I see well that thou wilt haue me, and ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:176965:37"/> that can serue me to resist thy holie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance. Thou hast possessed all the powers of my sowle, so that the obiects are remooued, which had fastened them to the earthe, and now they look vpward vpon thee who art the last end of all things; But alas (o most gracious and mercifull sauiour) what is ther in me, which prouoking thy mercie, hath cawsed thee to turne the eyes of pittie vpon me? what is there in me, which might in anie sort be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of such a vocation? nothing certanlie, but great maymes, corruptions, and sinnes, which rather prouoking thy furie and indignation, should banish me from thy presence, and haue cawsed dreadfull punishment and eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For it proceedeth from thy loue and mercie, that I yet liue in the desert of this world: thy loue hath beene my buckler &amp; my support, and now by an infinite excesse therof thou dost drawe me from the world and setlest my feete in the right pathe, and doest conduct me thorough a most perillous wildernes. Guide therfor, O lord, thy most wretched creature, and impotent seruant, doe with me what shall seeme best in thy eyes. I resigne my self wholie to thee, and cast my self into thy armes: frame all my actions, &amp; conduct all my desires, to the glorie of thy holie name.</p>
                     <p>Thus he put on a couragious resolution, which he did not differ long after to execute,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176965:37"/> and to become a noble souldier of our blessed sauiour, &amp; serue hym vnder the ensignes of seraphical S. Francis, and so to make hym self a pleasing holocaust before god, offering his bodie to hym by the vowe of perpetual chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his sowle &amp; affections by holie obedience, and his goods and what soeuer he most posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by the vowe of voluntarie pouertie. Manie can be content, sometymes to entertaine good thoughts, which put them in mynd of the vanities of the world, and discouer them to be but lesse then the shadowes of a dreame, they will saye, that all that the world propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, resembleth the aples of Gomorrha, which ar fayre without, but smoak and ashes within: yea they wil call the world coosener, traytor, disloyall: and yet suffer themselfs to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, with her enchantments &amp; fayre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: but emong a hundred thowsand, it is hard to fynd one, which hath the courage to take such an heroicall resolution, but in the end they play the crauens, and become slaues to the world, and render it homage in most base &amp; ignoble manner.</p>
                     <p>Hauing now resolued to put this in executiō verie speedilie; he entered into deliberation, by what meanes he might effect his purpose, with least difficultie. He durst not reueal his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to anie man, for yf the king had had but the least notice of it, he would haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176965:38"/> his authoritie, to hinder it: and yf his brethrē had knowen yt they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie haue acquainted the king with it. Therfor he with out help of anie secular persō, did sett in order all his affayres of importance, and disposed secretlie of his howse. He gaue to the Reuerend fathers of the order of Minimes, that howse at Nijon, which he had bought being nere to the Capuchins, with twelue hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred french liures, for yearelie rent, (which ar payd to them still by Madame de Guise): obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to saye two masses, euerie daye for the intention of his mother &amp; wyfe, and to mantaine a schoolmaister for the instruction of yowthe, at the suburbes of S. Honore: &amp; he left to the Capuchins his gardens, who would not accept the howse; And in the end, he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged this busines so prudentlie, &amp; secretlie, that he tooke the habit before anie of his frēds suspected anie such matter: and so gaue his farewell to the world, in a most noble and pious manner, as it may appeare by a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie description of it, made by Monseigneur the Cardinal Perron of late, and happie memorie.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176965:45"/> fetching a deepe sighe, asked hym, what moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym to chose that kind of lyfe, so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his tender, and delicate constitution, which he thought could neuer support the yoke of such austerities? what discontentment he had receaued at the court, that he should forsake it, and enter into such a course of lyfe? yf he doubted of anie chainge of his affection towards hym: he would giue hym, as good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surāce of it, as euer anie man had. As for deuout seruing of god, he tould hym, God is fownd euerie where, and men maye work their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all places. That S. Lewis, and manie other saints had liued in the court, and yet cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to lead a holie lyfe. In fine, he tould hym, he should doe much wrong to this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yf he went on in this course of lyfe: and therfor prayed hym, by that loue &amp; affection, which a subiect oweth to his prince, who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, and loueth hym, that he would presēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie follow hym, and forsake this lyfe. What could he saye more, to abate the courage of a man of great resolution. His brethren tendered the same request, with all possible instance but all in vayne, for he had no eares, to harken to them, in this request. To the king, he made this answer.</p>
                     <p>Syr, it is not anie discontentment, that hath mooued me, to seeke this retrayte, &amp; incited me to the contempt of the world, and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176965:45"/> thereof: It is the grace of god, which in the plentie &amp; varietie of contentments, hath made me see they ar nothing but smoake. It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doubt or feare of your princelie affection for yow haue allwaies affected me, farr beyōd my desert. It is rather a lesson, which I haue learned of yow, which withowt my owne knowledg and practise, I haue also receaued from heauen. For how often, haue yow told me, when I was alone with yow, in your cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and entertained some thoughts of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that this world was full of deceiptfull baits, and that ambition (as a most cruel lyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) did deuoure the most zealous: and that it was fitt to follow those vocations which we haue from god; and as all things, tend to their center, so ought we to direct all our intentiōs to god. I haue now made my benefitt of these holie exhortations; permitt me, therfor I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie beseech yow, yf yow will doe me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour still to loue me, that I may staye here, and so enioye my contentment, for he that loueth, wisheth allwaies the contentment of hym whom he loueth.</p>
                     <p>He spake moreouer touching the vanitie of the world, that it is a poyson which infecteth in such a maner, that the most experiēced phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions in spirituall medecines, can hardlie avoyd it: that it is the daughter of the first of the diuels, sister to that enemitie, which he beareth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176965:46"/> to man: for to follow it, is to forsake god: &amp; to loue god is to detest it. God will not dwell in harts deuided. Besides this world is verie tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie, &amp; heauen is not giuen, but to those who take it by violence: that it is as hard to saue our sowles, amidst the pomps and vanities of the court, as to liue in the midst of a furnace, and not to feele the heat, of the flames. In fine his wordes preuayled so much with them, that they were well appeased, and retourned with contentment, admiring the goodnes of god, that had endewed so noble a bodie, with so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; heroicall a sowle.</p>
                     <p>After he had passed this first brunt, so coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouslie to the glorie of god, and ioye of his angells, he mett with a more daingerous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, which seazed vpon his powers and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the first encountring onely his affectiō: for what auayleth it, to will and desire anie thing, which is beyond our reache, and which we can not put in execution: no man performes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing well, to which he was not before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in will to doe, but manie loue great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which surmount their strength.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176965:46"/> bread which was giuen in almes to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, took awaye his appetite, at the verie sight: neither could he drink of the claret wyne, for besides that it was sowre and sharpe, and mixt of diuers kynds; it may be he neuer vsed, to drink of that sort of wyne. These were dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous batteries, able to subdue a braue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. The phisicians concluded, (whether for fauor, or for monie, it is not knowen that he must necessarilie forsake his religiō, for to saue his lyfe. His brethren in the mean tyme vsed all sollicitation they could for this end, hoping that by gayning of tyme, he would change his purpose. But the religious helping hym with their prayers, his charitie triumphed ouer all these to gods glorie, and the encrease of his merits. He cared not for death, and was not vnwilling to qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>His blessed mother, Madame de Ioyeuse, onelie among all his friends did passionatelie desire his perseuerance and to this purpose she visited hym often, and encouraged hym, as much as laye in her, being her self much aduā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the schoole of perfection: and as he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed hym self, the sight onelie of her, was in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176965:47"/> stead of strong refection, &amp; strengthned hym much in this holie course of lyfe, in defpyte of all the brusk encounters of the world, the flesh, and &amp; diuel. She sēt hym euerie daye two lofes of bread, with a litle botle of whyte wyne, and god, who neuer giueth vs good desyres, withowt force to performe them, did distill downe this benediction vpon this bread, that with verie litle or no other meat, he passed the tyme of three moneths, in that rigorous fast, which the religious doe exactlie obserue. So powrefull is loue, that when it comandeth our actions, all the greatest contrarieties, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts, ar made easie and sweet. During this tyme he accustomed hymself, by litle and litle to eate of the common meat, and at the length gayned so much of hym self, that ther was not anie of the religious, (who had been never so hardlie bred) that could passe with this nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment more easilie thē hymself: in so much, that he contēted hym self with hearbs, beanes, pease, pulse and for the most part with bread and water, while others eat such meat, as was brought home, at the comon almes: whervpō he was reputed one of the most austere of his profession.</p>
                     <p>The morrow after he took the habite, the religious fathers, withowt regard of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, (for emong them, ther is no distinction of persons for their birth, be they noble, or of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176965:47"/> meane parentage) begann to put hym, to all vile and base exercises, both bodilie and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, fit for the tryall of those, who enter into the schoole of mortification. And he withowt anie disdaine, or anie repining obeyed in all things, with great promptnes, so that he was the first in all these exercises, &amp; serued for an example to incite others. What a chainge is this, that he which was yesterday cladd richlie like a prince, attended with manie servants, and obeyed as a great seigneur of his rank, the daye following cloatheth hym self with a course sack, &amp; is comanded, to digg and labour in a poor māner? That he, which was serued with so much respect and honor, subiecteth hym self to sweep chambers, and wash others poore dishes: that he who yesterday with Ioseph bore swaye and rule in the greatest and weightiest affayres of the king, to daye with Mardoceus, cladd with sackcloath and ashes is despised, and put to doe those base offices, which ar enioyned to Nouices, for proofe of their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and to quell their propre will, the plague and bane of religious sowles. What pleasure he took in these humiliations, it is not easilie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, God which knoweth the hart, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence hym accordinglie; and by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, we may easilie conclude, his true since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and perfect humilitie.</p>
                     <p>It happened in the tyme of his Nouiceship,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176965:48"/> that the Duke of Ioyeuse, (his eldest brother) and an other of his brethren were slaine, at the bataille of Coutras, for the defence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick saithe, and the state of their countrie, whose death was a cawse of great mourning to all France. Their bodies according to their qualitie, were brought to Paris, &amp; receaued with as much honour, according to an ancient manner as yf they had returned in conquest, and laden with the spoyles of their enemies, They were attended by a solemne procession, vnto the church of S. Iaques du Haulte pas, where it pleased the king also, to assist them, giuing an ample testimonie of his affection, towards those who had layd downe ther liues for his defence: and he did not leaue them, till he saw their funeralls, ended according to their merit, and valoure. Here among the religious persons, the Capuchins were present, to saye the office of the dead for their intētion: among whom, ther was hardlie fownd anie one, which could recite the office withowt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of teares and groanes. Onelie this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel (though yet but a nouice, withowt anie exteriour signe of such sorrow, continued the singing of the office, and kept in that great sorrow, which did more nearlie presse hym, then anie other. This death of his brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the griefe, which he had therby, was also a shrewd temptatiō to hym: for he was partlie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:176965:48"/> moued by the blood, which can not but boyle in such a case, and partlie by diuers of his frēds, who vnder coulour of consolation visited hym often, to take the reueng of his brethrens deathe. But his buckler to resist these dartes, was a verse of Salomon, which he had learned by hart, and had often in his mouthe; <hi>Sonne vvhen thou comest to serue god stand in feare, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy hart for tentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There arriued yet to hym, a more dainge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation, then anie of these former. Wheras these came not but from the world, and the flesh, which ar to be subdued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but this last came from god, whome it pleased to take from hym, that inward guift, which he had: so that all things, which seemed before sweet to hym, soodainlie became sowre, and vnpleasāt, for the inward cōsolatiō, which is as the breast which god maketh his young ones to suck, so to make them finde cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment amidst all austerities and irksomnes of flesh and blood; was taken from hym, so that now he fell into a wonderfull drynes, and languour of spirit, not fynding anie gust in his prayers, meditations, and holie exercises, which ar as it were the Aromatical perfumes of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout sowle. Notwithstanding all this, he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not, to frequent the same holie practise of his deuotions, neither was gods grace impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hym herby: for the best spiritualists,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:176965:49"/> know well, that ther is a great difference, between the practises of pietie and deuotion, and feeling a pleasure and sweet gust therin, the one being a direct act, which tendeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie to god, as to the vtmost obiect: the other is an action of our knowledg, which cawsing a reflexion vpon that, which we haue donne, bringeth with it ioye and contentmēt. The first is a pure act of vertue, the second is the fruit which we gather therof: god concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the first, and so by it, ar the solide actions of vertue exercised: but he depriueth vs of the second, which is our knowledg, whence riseth our contentment, whence dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes cometh in steed of clearenes, and drienes of spirit in the place of affection, &amp; heauienes in steed of ioye. For more familiar explicatiō of this, we know that he, which being extreame thirstie, shall take anie liquor into his stomach withowt tasting it, should certanlie drink it though he should not beleeue it, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he findeth no contentment in the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: so fareth it, when god taketh away his comforts, we doe not cease, to exercise vertuous actions, but yet the want of our knowledg and gust, maketh vs to think that we doe not these actions.</p>
                     <p>Being in this distresse he discouered his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection to his superior, which is the best armour of defence a nouice can vse, in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:176965:49"/> anie such temptations. The religious fathers assisted hym by theire holie prayers, and his vertuous mother was not wanting to encoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage hym assuring hym that it was god who would prooue hym, &amp; that he did oftē treat in this manner his best fauorits. And therfor he which doth mortifie, and quicken againe, whē it pleaseth hym, who bringeth vs to the brink of hell, &amp; bringeth vs back according to his holie will, after he had tryed his resolution, and made hym triumph ouer all these batteries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpenced hym an hundredfold for these payns, and anguishes, which he sustained. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that one night, after mattins, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious being all retired into their cells, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the church praying: &amp; ther prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hym self before the alter, he forced hym self to ouercome this great desolation, wher wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For after all these incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of temptation, he had a violent combate, in debating with hym self, whether the lyfe of Carthusians, and their solitude, were not more proper &amp; fitt for hym. But recommending this to god in earnest prayer, he receaued inspiratiō from god, that he should perseuer in that course of lyfe, which he had now vndertaken. Whereupon he came to the Reuerend father Iulien (maister of the Nouices) and sayd in his eare to hym, My Father, I haue made a vowe to god, to liue and dye a Cappuchin. From that tyme he enioyed a sweet repose, and calme of his sowle. All his mortifications were pleasures to hym, his shirts of heyre were roses, his fastinges were great bākets, his disciplines were delights, and the grace which he receaued from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176965:50"/> aboue, was so well entertained by his coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he went on couragiouslie in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended course, and was neuer after disquieted by anie accident.</p>

The tyme of his profession being come, that he was to enter into an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with god by solemne vowe to liue the rest of his dayes in most simple pouertie, most pure chastitie, and most perfect obedience: he humblie requested the Reuerend father F. Bernard d'Ozimo, who was to receaue hym in the presence of all the religious on gods part; that he wold admitt hym emong the professed Religions, as he had done the yeare before emong the Nouices. This good father whose words were pearcing euen to the inward marrowe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to make hym apprehend the vglie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vices, and the beautie of vertue, with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176965:51"/> the different end of the one and the other, knowing of what great importance a vowe of of Religious is, by which he can not doe that vnder payne of damnation, which he might haue donne before, withowt the least scruple of offending God: bent his persuasions with all feruour, to lett hym see the sweetnes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, (which was as yet in his power): that it was a small matter to forsake our ease, and commodities, but to forsake our will, that this was a great entreprise. He told hym that he might yet freelie enioye his cōtentmēts and the court, that he might buy heauen better cheape, and that the king and his frends would receaue infinit contentment thereat. In fyne, he sayd Religion was so heauie a yoke, that the most couragious did stoope to sustain yt; that he had tasted somewhat this yeare past, but all that was but hoonie, in comparison of that, which he must suffer, as to passe mountaines couered with snowe barefooted, besides that this was a marriage, which can not be broken, so that in stead of cōmanding he must obey, abandon his owne proper affections, die to his naturall desyres, despise worldlie passions, make light of all reuilings and opprobries, embrace ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Wherfor prostrating hymself before the alter, he solemnised this contract of his profession, with vnspeakable ioye, putting hym self into the hands, of this blessed father his superior. O mutation or rather resurrectiō, to giue the last farewell, to inclinations of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie, and worldlie delights in this manner! This food is too hard of disgestion, for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinarie sowle, it is such, that God doth not giue but to his best fauorites. His profession being made, it is almost incredible, how he augmented his feruor in prayer, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie in fasting, his rigour in disciplines; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing god, from the bottom of his sowle, that he had called hym to this kynd of lyfe, which cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised all his former benefits. These are his own words.</p>
                     <p>O my sowle, blesse our lord, and forget not his benefitts: this (saith he) is an abbrigement of all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176965:52"/> the rest, a new creation, a new iustification, a new redemption, an earnest-pennie and gage of glorification, in fine, a consummate heape of all the mercies of god. And by a long inductiō, repeating the mercies and benefitts bestowed vpon hym, he putteth first the plenarie absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which a religious man hath, bothe from sinne, and the payne due to yt. Secondly that it cureth all maladies, contracted by sinne, to witt ignorance by an amorous knowledg of god, which is called Sapience or wisedome. It cureth frayletie, by the succor of superabundāt grace, It healeth concupiscene, by loue of god; and mallice, by the loue of our neighbor. Thirdly a religious person is exempt, frō manie occasions of sinne. Fourthlie god hath singular care of them, and protection. Fifthlie, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of spirituall consolations, accōpanieth yt, in somuch that a religious persō as an eagle renueth, and trāsformeth hym self into Iesus Christ, by grace in this lyfe, to be wholie changed into hym, by glorie in the lyfe to come.</p>
                     <p>To enioye these benefitts, he sayd, I would (my brethren) we did beare a singular loue to our rule, and that euerie one of vs did vse diligence for the strict obseruation of yt. The first thing that we should doe, were dailie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the promise we made, at our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siō: The second is to take ioye, in that we haue
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176965:52"/> made this promise &amp; vowe, &amp; daily to renue it. The third is to meditate euery daye in the weeke in this māner. On Sōday, vpō Obediē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: Mūday on chastitie: Tuesday on pouertie. Wednesday on Charitie: Thursday on humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Friday, on pennance and mortification, in our habit, in our sleepe, in our meate: and Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, on the peace, which ought to be emong vs. The fourth is, humblie to request our supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and brethren, that they would aduertise vs, and admonish vs of our faultes and defects, in the obseruation of the rule &amp; constitutions, to the end that we may amend them, and receaue willinglie their reproofes for so good an end. The fifth is, to take one day euerie moneth, for a generall and exact examination of all faultes, comitted against the rule, and to accustome hymself, to doe some particular penance for the same faults. and in this manner, sayd he, we might exercise our selfs, to a trew obediēce of our rule, which we haue promised to keepe. And loe heere the frame &amp; modele of his lyfe, (expressed in his owne words,) which he did lead frō the daye of his profession, subdewing still the desyres of the flesh, and making it obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to the spirit, by violence of austerities, &amp; mortification.</p>
                     <p>The first tyme that vpon obedience he took anie voiage a foot, (as it is their custome neuer to ryde, withowt extreame necessitie) the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176965:53"/> soles of his feet were so tender, that before he had gone fiue leagues, he was fayne to bynd his handkerchif abowt them, least they might be sore hurt by the hardenes of his sandalls. And in deed the payne was so dolorous, that he could not go, till his compagniō was forced to procure an asse to carrie hym to the place whither they went. But after this voiage, his feet were so inured &amp; hardened, that he went twise to Rome and being prouinciall of the order for six yeares together, he went euerie yeare three or fowr hundred leagues a foot, in visiting the prouince. It is almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, what austerities he vsed, bothe at home &amp; abroad. If as he was abroad ther was much good meate presented to hym: he wold take of the meanest sort, both to suppresse the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sensualitie, as also to giue good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to secular persons, who skann narrowlie all the actions of religious men. He avoyded all occasions of meetings, where he thought, he might be knowen, least he might be treated better then a poore Capuchin. Therfor he choose rather to retyre hym self, to the cabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the poorest sort, then to great howses, where he should be well entertained. He fasted all the eues of our Sauior, &amp; our B. Ladie, and disposed hymself to receaue new graces, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie and fresh mortifications: discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hym self, with great rigour, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176965:53"/> hym self, with bread and water, which he did eate on his knees, as a man vnworthie of so good refection. And his bodie contrarie to the ordinarie manner, was nothing weakened, by these penances, but did daylie augment, &amp; renew its forces, and continnued them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owt anie mitigation, euen to the howre of his deathe.</p>
                     <p>One or two yeares after his profession, the ciuill warres were so hoate in France, that there was nothing almost to be seene in all parts, but the markes of fyre and sword, as was euident by infinite churches ruinated, &amp; chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells spoyled and sacked, holie altars ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, by the furie of a pretended religion. To avoyd these cruelties &amp; insolencies, which such trowbles bring with them, besides the great disquieting of good and peacable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Fa. Prouincial was constrayned to send manie religio{us} to Rome, among whom was this blessed father Angel Ioyeuse. This long voiage weakened hym much, together with the incomodities which they suffer, who carrie no moonie as the poore Capuchins ar faine to doe, relying wholie on gods prouidēce. When he was come to Florence, the Duke was desyrous to see hym, bycause he had hard much spoken of hym, worthie of admiration: &amp; with the permission of the Gardiē, the Duke had long discours with hym, so that the Duke
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176965:54"/> sayd openlie that there was somewhat in hym more then humain, which comendation made hym change his coulor, so humble he was, and loued rather contempt then prayse.</p>
                     <p>He was informed before he came owt of France, that the Religious Obseruants, had a habit, which S. Francis did weare, (which they esteemed as a pretious relique, and make great daintines to showe it to anie man, being lockt vp in a cofer with two keyes, wheareof the Duke keepeth one, and the Conuent an other. Therfor the Duke making offer, of anie fauor he might doe hym, according to the manner of great princes, he humblie thanked hym, and tould hym the poore Capuchins, stood in need of nothing, but yet being, a child of S. Francis, he should much oblige hym, yf by his fauor he might see the habit of this Seraphicall Saincte, which was in the custodie of the Observants. His Highnes granted hym this request, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired father Gardien to shew it to hym. He had also this grace donne to hym, that he was permitted, to put yt vpon his owne habit, &amp; seing it was like to his in coulor, and roughe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in fashion, and in the Capuce or hood, listing vp his eyes to heauen, and streaching owt his armes (displayed in manner of a crosse) he cryed owt with a most lowd voyce, O god what happienes is this, that I haue obtayned that which I so much desyred: I am now fullie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176965:54"/> content, and my sowle hauing abandoned all earthlie affections, doth regard nothing (O my god) but thee who art my soveraigne good, and last felicitie.</p>
                     <p>Going from Florence, he took his iourney towards Rome, which iourney he made with great payne and difficultie, being verie sicklie, and ill disposed in bodie, yet at length arriuing there, not withowt suffering greate incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, he seiourned there some tyme, for the recouerie of his health, and restoring of his strength (much empayred, by so long and payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a voiage.) The R. Father General sent hym thence, to Venice, to studie diuinitie, where he passed his course in these studies, with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratiō. This course of Theologie being finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his dexteritie, and sufficiencie well knowen, to the R. father General, both vpon his owne, &amp; other mens experience, he was sēt to Lorrain, &amp; made Guardian in a Cōuent. In which charge he carried hymself so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie (as in all other busienes wherin he was to employe his authoritie) that he made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, he was as fitt, to comand, as to obeye: as well experimented for practise, as for specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: finallie, as prudent and iudicious, as he was austere and sharpe in mortifications.</p>

                     <p>THis blessed father Angel Ioyeuse, hauing continewed some yeares in Lorraine, and edified all the contrie by his eminent example; the R. Fa. Generall, yeelding to the instant prayers, of the french fathers sent hym into Gascoigne: for they thought that his onelie presence (abstracting from his practise of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vertue) was greatlie necessarie there: &amp; that the whole order of religious men, would haue therby matter of great consolation, for god diuers tymes maketh vse of the motiues of our own proper interest, to put in execution the purposes of his eternall prouidence: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we can not comprehend the cawse, but by the knowledg of the effects. All the order of Religion wished that he might be sent into Gascoigne, but they did not foresee that he should be taken owt of his religion there, &amp; so incurr the danger to loose hym wholie. He was no sooner come thither, but he was made Gardian at Tolose, to the great contentment of all the religious, and the chief men of that parliament in that cittie, thinking it a great cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to haue hym for Superiour emong good
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:176965:55"/> religious men, whose parēts and brethren had obliged the whole contrie to them, by theire trauailes, for the comon good. But alas, all this ioye was but a flashe, which presentlie was gone; &amp; a great griefe succeeding, made them loose all the confort of their former ioye. For Monseigneur Scipio de Ioyeuse, Liuetenant general for the king in Languedoc, hauing lost, his lyfe in a battaile, against the Huguenots in the siege at Villemur, fiue leagues frō Tolose, all the contrie was much afflicted by his death for want of a gouernor, and principall leader the ciuill warres being there most hote. And the nobles and people of this contrie were so affected to this howse and familie of Ioyeuse, that they wold not content thē selfs with anie other (whereas France had manie noble and worthy persons) but one of this howse.</p>
                     <p>Herepon, all the flower of noble gentlemen in Languedoc, who had followed his deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed brother, accompanied with the chiefe men of the Parliament, humbly besought Monsei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneur Cardinal de Ioyeuse, to take compassion on their case, and to accept this charge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Gouernour and father to them, in so vrgent necessitie. He desired them to excuse hym, as being verie vnfitt for such a charge, in regard of his profession: and besides, he told them this were to bring in more confusion, in steed of setting better order, and to ruinate the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176965:56"/> prouince, in thinking, to raise yt, and confort it: whearas I haue more need, to be gouerned, then I haue experience to gouerne others. Yet his compassion, and affection towards them, made hym think of his brother, who was rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a cloyster lyfe, hauing hertofore showed hym self, in the court, with great honour and credit. O blessed sowle, thou art now in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of such trew repose, as can be had on earth, and now they enter into counsell, how they may put thee into the hell of troubles and vnquietnes.</p>
                     <p>This blessed father, thought of nothing lesse, then such a brunt, thoughe the diuel danced for ioye, thinking to haue gayned more, by this market, then he did, and gaue manifeste signes of it, which had beene able to haue frighted hym, yf he had much reflected on yt. For one night, while he was taking his rest, vpō his hard couche, he hard an extraordinarie noyse, that the diuel made on the flowre, beating the grownd &amp; the tables, with his sā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls. He wakens vpon yt, &amp; saw to his thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a religious man full of heauienes and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, sett in a chayre: which this enemie of man, had stript of his habit violentlie, and had put on hym a fyne shirt, with other cloathes, which might be fitting for a courtier. This vision, did not much trowble hym, bycause from the tyme of his Nouiceship, he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:176965:56"/> such: thinking it was onelie some tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to distract hym, and breake his sleepe that he might be the more vnable, to performe the good religious exercises, of the day following, litle thinking, that it touched hym so neare, till he sawe hym self, out of his habit and cloister.</p>
                     <p>At this tyme ther liued, a verie vertuous &amp; deuout damoselle, whome the glorious Saint Charles Borromeus did much esteeme for her vertuo{us} lyfe, and particular reuelations, which made her famous thorough all Italie.

                        </gap>uing had cōmunication with hym formerlie, when he came from Venice; knowing what a griefe it is, to a trew religious deuout sowle, to return to the world, after the trew and sweet delights of religion, wrote to hym, a month before he left his cloyster, (althoughe the letter came to hym, but fiue dayes after he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken his habit) and exhorted hym not to be dismaid, and troubled in that he should be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to returne to the world, &amp; follow the court for (saith she) it is gods will, it should be so. But she assured hym, that he should resume his habit againe, and end his dayes gloriouslie in that order of religion, &amp; so consequenlie should encrease his merit before god, more then yf he had gone on still in his course, withowt interruption. In the end of her letter, she promised to remember hym in her prayers,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176965:57"/> as one that was particularlie recommended to her, in a second place, euen by gods holie inspiration.</p>
                     <p>The nobles and Parliament men, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their resolution taken, came the next morning, to speak with hym at the Conuent: who did coniure hym by the affection which all his familie had allwaies witnessed, towards their prouince, and by the charitie, wherwith they dowbted not, but he was inflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbor, to take cōpassion of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liō of sowles, which were in dainger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowred of the roaring lyon, and in most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate case for want of a Pastor: and therfor they besought hym instātlie, to laye down his habit, and take vpon hym the charg of his brother and to stand in this breach for their defence, against so dangerous enemies of the church. This their request made his hart bleed for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for on the one syde, the great distresse, of gods church mooued hym to the quick: on the other syde he had a wōderfull reluctation, &amp; stryfe with in hym self, to quitt his trew contentment of his solitarie &amp; religious lyfe: wherfor he spake to them in this manner. My masters, your intention is verie commendable, &amp; your dessigne, full of zeale, for the commō good. But I pray vow remember, that I am a religious man, that I haue wholie abandoned the world, and that I haue oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Iudge yee therfor, of how great a cryme I shall be culpable, yf I break my vowe, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a bāquerout to my religiō, which I haue professed God, who can not be the author of sinn, &amp; punisheth often the sinnes of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rēts in their childrē, &amp; of the Pastors in smiting their flock, in steed of defending this prouince from the hands of their enemies (as it is meet to think, that this is gods hand which is vpon vs) may forsake it, &amp; leaue yt, to the spoyle of the enemie, for my fault. Yow haue manie noble, and worthie men, of great iudgmēt, and experience) make vse of them, who ar able to steed yow, much more then a poore religious who will be skorned of those enemies: reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing also, to see monasteries &amp; religious howses made emptie by them, it being one of their maine proiects. This was all they could gayne of hym, at this tyme: yet they sett a watch vpon hym, that he might not go, into anie other place, purposing to take hym owt by force, yf no other meanes would preuayle.</p>
                     <p>In the meane whyle, there was a solemne and publique meeting, of the nobles, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and religious men at Toloje, in the hall of the Archbushop: wko after they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated this matter verie seriouslie, concluded
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176965:58"/> with one cōsent, and voyce, that in such a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick necessitie, he was bownd in conscience, (seeing that all the Prouince, allso desyred it) to quit his habit, and to take a sword, and serue the weale publick, which was to be perferred, according to the rigour of deuine &amp; humain lawes, before his owne particular good. They went therfor againe the next morning to the Covēt, with full resolutō, to take hym foorth; and there they enforced theire requests, with all vehemencie, &amp; demanded his assistance, and presence, but for a tyme, promising, that they would aduertise his holienes of yt, &amp; obtaine his leaue as they did. For he sent his consent, with the resolution of two Cardinalls, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and Baronius, who were of opinion, that this act was lawfull and expedient.</p>
                     <p>This was the last blowe which made hym yeald, seeing also the cries &amp; lamētation of the people, who had besett the Cōuēt on all sydes and cryed with a pittie full voyce, and able to mooue anie mans hart, We will haue Fa. Angel, for our gouernor: and in case he wold not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to theire requests, they threatned to take hym by force, &amp; burne the Cōuent. How then was he able, to resist this powerfull call of the people, which may be well thought to be the voyce of god. He replied onelie, that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of entring into religion, and forsaking fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, and his onelie daughter, in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176965:58"/> the cradle, (the greatest obiect of his earthlie contentments) was to resigne hym self, wholie into the hands of god, and to avoyd by all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible meanes, the occasions of offending hym: which rather thē he would doe, he would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe a thowsād deaths. But since the learned Cleargie men, were of that mynd, that he was to follow gods will therin, he protested, that he did leaue his cloyster vnwillinglie, &amp; that yf ther were anie offence to god, that they should and must beare yt, and answer for hym. So weeping bitterlie, after he had embraced all his religious brethrē) who for sobbing &amp; weeping were not able to speak to hym) he forsook his habit, and sayd (being drenched in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of sorrow) fare well my repose and my comfort.</p>
                     <p>The next morning he came foorth in a black suite, to witnesse his inward mourning, &amp; his brother Mōseigneur the Cardinal, Archbushop of Tholose girt hym with a sword. All the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, Presidēts &amp; counsellours of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reioyced exceedinglie at this sight, and persuaded thēselues, that hauing obtayned his assistance, peace was allreadie mayde &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. They came to hym, to congratulate hym, with all signes of great chearefullnes, &amp; thankfullnes to hym for this fauour, making solemne protestatiō, that they would dye at his feete, what soeuer enterprise he should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176965:59"/> His answer was short, but pithie, and comfortable. Yow know (saith he), to satisfie your importunate request that I haue forsaken my earthlie paradise, to returne againe into Aegipt, and into the desert of trowbles and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes, for the seruice of god &amp; his church &amp; Frāce in generall, &amp; particularlie your contrie: this actiō is sufficient to make yow vnderstand, my hartie affection towards you, I hope, the heauens will fauour vs so, that the clowdes and foggs, which threaten a terrible storme and tēpest of warr, shall be dispersed by the bright beames of the sonne, and spring of a holie and assured peace, to the end that I may returne, to my former repose, and there end my dayes.</p>
                     <p>From thence, he went to a great place in the cittie, called S. Steuens, where he was receaued of the people, with great showes of ioye, &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment. Among all his excellēt perfections, this was worthie of admiration, that he had so vniuersal a spirit, &amp; plyable to what he would bend yt; that continuallie being vnited to god by loue, and by his inward thoughts, he gaue satisfaction to euerie one according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, for he had, no sooner taken his sword, &amp; fashoned the heyre of his head and beard in an other manner, but he gaue infinite contentmēt to all the nobles, who came to salute hym, and so behaued himselfe to euerie one of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their rank and qualitie, in that graue
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176965:59"/> and decent manner, as yf he had neuer liued a Cloyster man. He show de allso in his naturall sweetenes, (which represented somewhat a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious person (a gate &amp; port full of maiestie (as the qualitie of a gouernour and Captaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, to keep soldiers, within the bowdnes of their dewtie) that following his guard emong the nobles, manie did obserue something in hym, more then common &amp; ordinarie, which made hym much admired and honoured of all.</p>
                     <p>Shortlie after, seeking all meanes, to reduce things into order, he assembled the states of that prouince at Carcassone: where he entred into treatie, for a truce for three yeares, with Monsieur Marischal Montmorency, his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and kinsman, one of the most braue and noble Seignieurs of his tyme, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his merits, honowred with the charge of Constable of France. This truce, bringing peace and quiet which had been so lōg wished, was so sweet and gratefull to each partie, that they bothe did magnifie the mediatour of yt, perswading themselfs that god had sent hym, as in Angel of peace, and for their deliuerie. And in deed this particular truce in Languedoc, drew on the like thorough all France: &amp; after the happie reduction of Henry the fourth into the bosome of gods holie church, this truce grew to be a peace, so that ther followed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>While these affayres were so prosperouslie menaged, by this blessed Fa. Angel, our holie father the pope, being aduertised, of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, &amp; dexteritie, in directing of affayres of importance, and of what authoritie and credit he was, and how necessarie his presence was, for the gouernment of Languedoc, to the end, that he might ease &amp; cleare hym of anie scruple, which might happilie rise in his mynd, by reasō of his first profession, he chainged his vowe of a Cappucin, with that of the order of S. Iohn of Hierusalem: and sent hym, vpon his own proper motion, an Authenticall Bull, by which he did fullie absolue hym, frō the vowe which he had made emong the Cappucins, giuing hym power, to succeed, sell, buy, possese, and to performe other such actions; as yf he had neuer beene religious, onelie marriage excepted, which is forbiddē, by the vowe of the knights of Malta. This bull was executed by Mōsieur the Bushop of Lodene, Bushop of Carcassone, who is latelie deceassed; who at that tyme, being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, by a Commanded of Malta, gaue hym the whyte crose, to the great desyre, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the whole order.</p>
                     <p>All this could not alter his purpose of resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the habit, those spirituall comforts which he had taisted in that lyfe, were still imprinted in his hart, and although he was owt of his cloyster, and absolued from the obseruing of

For his blessed mother, as long as she liued, ceased not, as a holie S. Monica, to shed manie teares for hym, and to offer vp her prayers daylie to god, for his returne to religiō. Besides a learned &amp; vertuous father of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, exciting hym often, by liuelie and pressing remonstrances, &amp; pious exhortations, keept hym waking, that he fell not into anie profund lethargie, into which the world casteth her best fauorits.</p>
                     <p>Abowt the end of the trowbles of France, his mother Madame Mareschal, departed this lyfe at Tolose, the mirrour of all vertue &amp; pietie: who making an end conformable to her lyfe, left great occasion of mourning, to all France for her deathe. He assisted her allwaies in her last sicknes, with great edification; and took her blessing, and her speeches, euen to the last gaspe: which were as goads to hym, to stirr hym vp, to the loue of god, and living flames of that inward holie fyre, which consumed her sowle, and most certain pledges of the glorie, which she was to receaue after her decease.</p>

In these iourneys to Paris, he treated with the kings consent and fauour, the marriage of Madame Henriette de Ioyeuse, his onelie daughter, with the most illustrious prince Henry de Bourbon, duke of Montpensier which marriage afterward being accōplished, by heauēlie benediction brought foorth, a most noble plant, Marie de Bourbon, Madamoselle de Mōtpensier a princesse of our tyme, &amp; a trew image of the perfections of her father and mother.</p>

                     <p>NOw when as all things went on so pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouslie, with this blessed father: no mā thought, that he would once haue dreamed of returning to his former lyfe; and the rather by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he seemed in owtward appearance, to court these fauours of his prosperous successe n the world. But euen at this tyme had he a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remembrance, &amp; memorie of his trew cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176965:61"/> past, which as a waking ghost, seazed his imagination, and hindered entrance for anie other thoughts, which fauoured of the world, or of ambition. He was so wise, that he knew well, the inconstancie of all worldlie things, &amp; how weak the foundation is, when we build our hopes vpon them: &amp; therfor how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he might in owtward show, prudentlie seeme to look chearfullie vpon the world, it was for no other reason, but to carrie his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as secretlie, as he could, neither was it the scruple of his vowe, which cawsed hym to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre hym self, for he was well assured of the sufficiencie of his dispensation, euen in the iudgment of the most learned. So that it was onelie the loue of god with a desire of trew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with him, which cawsed hym to be nayled again to the crosse of au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He reuealed his intention, to a father of the same order (who preaching in Aduent, &amp; the whole Lent, at S. Stephens, (the Metropolitan church of Tolose) stirred vp manie to deuotion, by his learned discourses &amp; feruor. This father missed none of his sermons, what busienes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had, &amp; he heard hym oftentimes with teares. After his sermon, he took occasiō to see hym, and conferred with hym, abowt some
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176965:62"/> poynts, which he had more particularlie noted; he congratulated hym of his manner of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, saying that he preached, as a trew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, reproouing vice, &amp; exhorting to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, withowt those curiosities, which manie affect, which indeed ar rather beseeming a theater then a pulpit. In the end, after manie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, he opened his hart to hym, &amp; communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hym, his firme resolution, to resume the habit. To that end he required the ayd of his good prayers, &amp; of his counsells, because he saw manie blocks in his waye, which were hardlie to be remooued.</p>
                     <p>This father knowing well, the course of the whole busienes, delt with hym wiselie, &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, and would not approoue this motion, dowbting as he tould hym, least his retraict to religious lyfe, might preiudice the publique peace. He sayd that god had drawen hym once owt of the wotld, to make hym vnderstand better the vanities of the world: to the end, that returning againe into the world, he might stand more warilie on his guard, &amp; not be so easily surprised of those enemies, which cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuate the greatest part of noble persons. He towld hym also that heauen was not only for religious men, that he might verie well saue his sowle in the world: &amp; with as much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the vocation &amp; profession in this noble &amp; illustrious order of Malta: &amp; to conclude, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176965:62"/> persuaded hym that he might receaue more cleare direction from god, in a busienes of so great import, which did concerne his saluation, &amp; the conseruation of a state, to frequent the B, Sacrement, often to this end: &amp; then no doubt, but god would concur extraordinarilie, with those actiōs of pietie, &amp; lighten hym so by encrease of new graces, that he should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie vnderstand, his holie will.</p>
                     <p>Shortlie after he chose Fa. Ignace, an Italian, of the companie of Iesus a man of singuler learning &amp; prudēce for his cōfessor, to whome after his confession, he reuealed this his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This father (who had verie litle knowledg of hym before, thought that this was such a desyre, as would leese the edg vpon anie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siō of a litle opposition: &amp; that he might as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be diuerted from this purpose, bycause his frends had powre over hym, to cawse his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth of the Cloyster. But afterward he was of an other mynd and wondered at his strong resolution, and saw that his constancie was much to be honoured &amp; admired. Some moneths passed on, that he vsed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, all feasts &amp; Sondayes, commending this affayre to god. And he found that the violence of this affectiō grew daylie more &amp; more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he fell to importune that R. Father returning this āswere (as admirable as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) to his oppositions. <hi>Father, I doe beleeue

                     </p>
                     <p>After he had deposed his habit, he kept dearlie they peaces which he held verie pretious, the rule of S. Francis, &amp; a Discipline, which ar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable companions, to all Capuchins: the one is to haue allwaies in memorie, what they haue promised, the other to mortifie the fleshlie appetits: the one &amp; the other that they may be conforme &amp; like to their father. The third thing, was a book of spiritual exercises, verie proper, to the most perfect spirits. He begann from this tyme, to make these things more familiar, &amp; ordinarie, then before, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his nearest frends &amp; people of his owne howse, seing hym to with draw hymself often, to solitarie retraicts, and to avoyd all occasions of keeping companie, &amp; to passe most part of the night in his priuate cabinet, they begann to dowbt, least he was proiecting with hymself, a second retrayte to religious lyfe. Moreover he contented not hym self with this, but labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to store hym self, with some books of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, &amp; others of deuotion, which he could not read in the daye tyme, by reason that he was verie warie to conceale his purpose: &amp; therfor he spent that tyme of the night in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176965:63"/> those good books, which was ordained for his repose.</p>
                     <p>It happened one night, after his seruants were retyred from his chamber he attempted that which he had doone, whē he was but nine yeares of age, to witt, to take yt as from the mouth of god, and to know perfectlie his will, by the first words which he read in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the book. O good god, how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ar thy secrets! At the first opening &amp; vieu, he happened vpon the words of the Reuelatiō, which were in the sermons of the learned and subtile preacher Birōte. <hi>Be myndfull, vvhence thou art fallen, and doe pennance, and doe thy first vvorks.</hi> He needed no exposition to applie this to hymself. The next morning he told the Fat. Capuchin (comming from his sermon:) My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, god hath giuen me better inspirations, then ever I deserued: but he never spake so clearlie to me, as this night past. I must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deafe yf I hear not his voyce, &amp; verie igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yf I doe not vnderstand yt, and so tould hym what had passed. And certainlie there is no man but will iudg ther was something extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie.</p>
                     <p>This was at the beginning of lent, during which tyme he daylie augmented his deuotiōs. He vndestood shortlie after, that the R.

                        </gap> good father went not beyond the Conuent of Carcassone in the prouince of Toloze: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upō he wrote to hym &amp; acquainted hym with his purpose, and earnestlie requested the father, to whome he had opened his hart, to carrie his letters to hym, being now to go, to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chapter. In these letters he besought hym with al the powers of his sowle, &amp; by the vowe which he had made to S. Frācis, that he would receaue hym againe to their order, and send hym his obedience, to take the habit in that prouince, which he should iudg the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for avoyding of diuersion &amp; of trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>The R. Father General receaued his letter verie louinglie, &amp; wondring at his zealous māner of writing, sayd, that he was conducted &amp; guided infalliblie by gods holie spirit, yet he did not giue hym, but one half of that contēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he hoped for. He mayde hym this answer that he was verie desirous to gratifie hym, for the honour and the benefit which would redound therby to the order: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had bene dispensed withall by our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father (who did not giue such dispēsatiō but for a greater good, he could not receaue hym,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:176965:64"/> till he had aduertised the Pope therof, &amp; recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his cōsēt. This answer perplexed him much for he was afrayd, least his holienes would not yeald his consent, withowt comunicating the matter to the king, and he had no hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the kings consent. he not with standing determined, to send expresselie one of his own seruants, who carried letters from hym to our holie father Clemēt the 8. and to the protector of the Order, who was the Cardinal of Saint Seuerin. In these letters he declared his dessigne &amp; his humble suite, shewing them that he might put it in execution withowt anie preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the state. He coniured them with all earnest submissions, that a child oweth to his father, or an inferiour, to his superiour, that they would permit hym to follow those good inspirations, which god had giuen hym: &amp; that he could not differ it anie longer, withowt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent peril of his lyfe, so great was his disgust &amp; irksomnes, which he had of the world. These ar the holie violences of pure loue, not to fynd anie contentment, but in the possession of the obiect loued, whose absence is insupportable, bycause it carrieth with our hart, all our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the strongest passion of the sowle.</p>
                     <p>His holienes was much astonished at this deuotion, &amp; after he had well considered this affayre, with all the circumstances, perceauing that he was certainlie moued by gods holie
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176965:65"/> spirit to this act, he cūmanded the protector to signifie to hym, that yf he did iudg in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that his assistāce was no longer neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for the contrie of Languedoc, he was wel content, that he should resume the habit: but he exhorted him that as yet he would procede very aduisedlie, least his permission being obtayned, vnder a false pretext of sauing his lyfe, might occasion eternal deathe. and afterward exciteth hym to perseuere in this holie purpose, which God doth not recompence, but in the end and vpshott of the work: that he was like to be an adamant, to draw manie affections after hym: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God, and his holie church should be exalted by this worke, &amp; to this end gaue hym his holie benediction.</p>
                     <p>This being so past, the R. Fa. General, sent hym his obedience, to take the habit in that prouince, where he was most inclined in his deuotion: &amp; the yeares, which he had passed in the world with the popes dispensation, for the defēce of the church &amp; the state, were allowed to hym, as yf he had spent them in religion: for he went not owt but by violence, &amp; against his will: &amp; he confirmed to hym the title &amp; office of a preacher, which the R. Father Policius Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, had giuen hym before he left the habit. These letters reuiued hym, which was half dead before, by apprehending, that he should

                        </hi> Gen. had giuē him before he left the habit.</p>
                     <p>These letters reuiued him, which was half dead before, by apprehending, that he should be refused. He had no sooner receaued them, which was in the moneth of Iune, but he presēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prepared himself, to go to Paris, and to set in order all his affaires: &amp; likewise, that seing Mō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Montpensier, &amp; Madame (his daughter) he might taske his last farewell of them, yet so that they shuld not know he took his farewel.</p>
                     <p>It fell out in the mean tyme, by gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this good father, to whome he had reuealed his purpose at Tolose, was sent by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generall to preach at Paris, at S. German of Auxerrois, which was much to this good fathers comfort and ioye. He took this for a certain presage, that it was gods will, that the good father should assist hym to the end, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he had vsed in the beginning. And so he had cawse to thing: for after he had long conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what prouince should be most conuenient, for hym to make his new retraict, and after maine conflicts, between the flesh, and Reason (where of one required a place some what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, the other counselled him to choose a place neare his home, because he might not be depriued of his dearest frends, by distance of place, at last he concluded to goe to Suisse to take the habit, that so by distance of place, he might not be troubled with ordinarie visits,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:176965:66"/> which often occasion other dangerous distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Religious men. This consideration therfore, moued him to incline to goe to Suisse, but he was disswaded by this good man, who shewed vnto him effectually, that his retraict in the face of the court, would be much more edifying and exemplaire, and that his absenting of him selfe, would argue pusillanimitie and want of courage: that he neede not haue any other visits, but such as he would, and that such a spirit as his was, did not incurre danger, to be diuerted by any perswasion. And besides all this, that his presence would be very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for the consolation of Monsieur de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier, &amp; Madam his daughter who without doubt would be farr more afflicted, if they were not only depriued of his conuersation, but also of the fruit of his vertuous counsells. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resting vpon the aduise of this good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he wholie submitted him selfe to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the fathers of the conuent of Paris.</p>
                     <p>This consultation for choice of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient place for his reception, continued from S. Francis day, to the first weeke of Lent, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which space of time, he disposed of his worldly busines: and in the end it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he should take againe his habit in the conuent of Paris, for the reasons aboue speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And altough he was a litle otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in his owne iudgment, fore-seeing the extraordinarie importunitie of his friendes in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176965:66"/> this case, yet to shew himselfe truly obedient, as well out of religion, as in the same, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to follow their aduise: and he put this in execution so dexterouslie, that his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, vnderstood rather his retiring from that course, then any will and affection to returne. For the second Munday in Lent, anno 1599. the kinge being at Monceaux, he accompanied in the morning Monsieur de Espernon his brother in law, who went to the kinge, and brough thim on his way a league from Paris, and sent with him, one of his officers, who carried a pacquet of letters from him to his sonne Monsieur de Mountpensier. where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge other letters of compliment or conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there was one for the kinge, to whom he gaue to vnderstand, that it was Gods will (all thinges being setled in good peace) that he should returne to the centre of his repose, from whence he was taken, by the violence of afflicted people. Wherfore he humbly besought his Maiestie, that he would be pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the same, giuing him most humble and infinit thankes, for those offices and dignities, which he had bestowed vpon him, all which he now right humbly resigned againe vnto him, protesting to be perpetually mindfull of him, in his prayers and sacrifices.</p>
                     <p>It is needles to aske, whither the Kinge and the whole court were astonished at this newes, for the better to conceale his holy designe, he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:176965:67"/> seemed for a while, to loue the world with as much passion as others did. In the meane while, the same euening, after he had made an Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of his goods, with Monsieur de Marnef, and ordered the priuat affaires of his house, he retired him selfe to the conuent all alone, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seauen of the clock, giuing charge to two of his seruants, that they should not open the doore to any, whosoeuer came to knock there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and to answere them, that he did retire and rest him selfe, and that the next morning after the sermon, they should know the cause of his retirement. O blessed rest, the earnest of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, far different from that of the most part of worldly men, where the images of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired obiects trouble the imagination, &amp; cause dreames, which vnder the pretext of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a happie rest, produce eternall miserie to their conceiuers.</p>
                     <p>After some houses spent in prayer, solacing himselfe with the Angells, about eleuen of the clock before midnight, he tooke againe the habit before the high Altar, with vnspeakable ioy, and melting with inward contentment of hart, he renewed his profession, and his vowes, in the presence of all his bretheren, protesting that he would die in the practise of them. And as they would haue had him to stay vntill the morning, for the making of his crowne and razing of his haire conforme to the rule, he most earnestly requested father Alphonsus,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:176965:67"/> viccar and superior in the absence of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, that he might be dispatched out of hande, so that he might see nothing about him in the morning, that should sauour of the worlde: so desirous was he, to make this externall change, being already quite changed, and inwardly transformed in his soule. His crowne being made, he went to the quire to singe Mattins, with the others (their custome being to rise at midnight to rendar praises vnto God, whilst peraduenture other worldlinges, employ that time in workes of darknes) where he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that decency and reuerence, as if he had made no interruption at all from this holie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise: which many of the religious did much wonder at.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, this his change of life, being published by the preacher of S. German, was quickly knowen both in court and cittie; For this father hauing asisted him a yeare and a halfe, made (in forme of a funerall sermon) the end of his sermon vpon this subiect, with wordes so liuelie, and so full of fire, that he him selfe first breaking into teares, made his auditors also weepe, where this dukes owne Gentlemen, Pages, and other seruants were spectators, all strooken with great amazement vpon such tidinges, thinking that their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster reposed in his bed, euen then when he was become a Capucin. All the Princes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of honor hearing this, came likewise to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:176965:68"/> see him at the conuent, who when they saw him in the church amonge other religious, they could not forbeare to teares and sobbes in such dolefull maner, that they could hardly salute him. There was not one amongst them all, but Madam de Beliste, the sister of Madam de Longueuille (who was then treating to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a religious woman, and since both liued and died most blessedly in the Monasterie of the Encloistre) who had the courage to speake vnto him. She reioyced with him for this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie change, esteeming him most wise and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie to make this choice, and to despise and abandon all worldly thinges, which haue but vanitie for their being, and instabilitie for their foundation, and so to possesse God more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, whose rewardes fleete not with the worlde, but last for euer. He receiued these Ladies with a smiling countenance, and made them a short spirituall discourse, of the grace he had receiued from almightie God, and that this grace was of much more value, then the world could imagine; adding, that if men in the world should but taste of the sweete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of a Religious life, that priuat houses, would be changed into Monasteries: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they regard not but the externall face of thinges, which seemeth to be full of rigour, they bemoane them which are in this maner, sweetly drawen vnto God, from the wicked world, as if they had lost their wits and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:176965:68"/> and cast them selues into a sea of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. Wherfore he tould them, that if they had done him the honor to loue him, as he alwaies beleeued vnto that present, that they ought to reioice with him for this his change, because, this was the more safe and secure way to come to God, the finall end of all thinkes crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>This second conquest, being so gloriouslie gotten against the enimies of man, the world, the flesh, and the deuill, who had laboured to allure him by the charming baites of honors, riches, and sensuall pleasures, got him so much honor in the worlde, and so excited all france in the admiration of his virtues, that as a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Captaine, he drew out of captiuitie, and (that I may so speake) led in triumphe, a great number of Gentlemen and Courtiars, who following his steppes, sounded a retreate to all vanities, withdrew them selues from the billowes and waues of a courtly life (where the best experienced Pilots are often drowned) to liue in sweete repose vnder the shelter of the Crosse, within the cloistre of the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins.</p>

                     <p>The blessed father Angell of Ioyeuse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alwaies to haue an excellent naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto learning, and for paines in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he went beyond all others of his age and profession. He obserued also an excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode in his studie (which may serue for a rule to those who follow the same course) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to perfection: first he neuer opened booke without before hauing inuoked the asistance of Gods holie Spirit, knowing that all science and vnderstanding, is the gift of almightie God, and that knowledge which is not accompanied with charitie (the fire wherof is kindled by the spirit of loue) doth but puffe vp, and doth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176965:69"/> not edifie. Nether did he content himselfe only with lifting vp his hart to God, as many doe before they vndertake their studies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before studie, spent some time in prayer offering his affection vnto God, praying that if it were for his glorie, the good of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and his owne, that he would illuminat the darknes of his vnderstanding to conceiue the depth of his secrets stir vp his will to labour therin with feruour; quicken his memorie, and make it capable, to giue a good account of that which he should iudge fit for his vocation and rule; but if on the contrarie part, ether the health of his soule, or the puritie of his vowes, were to suffer therby any detriment what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that perpetuall ignorance might be the recompence, of all his labours and his trauells. It is hardly credible how great progresse he made in his studies, being moued therto, by so holie and so glorious an end.</p>
                     <p>His houres designed to his studies, were those, as when he had no other exercise in the conuent: for as touching his office, he neuer failed. And albeit the studients among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, are not dispenced with all for saying their houres in the quire, yet not withstanding, as though he had nothing else to doe, he was alwayes there one of the first, and witdrew him selfe thence as late as possibly he might: whence he receiued such extraordinarie light, that in one houre he conceiued and retayned more,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:176965:70"/> then many others did in a whole day.</p>
                     <p>He heard euery day one Masse, before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> heare, and oftentimes he serued another, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no time so well bestowed, and exciting others to deuotion by his profund humilitie, in his maner of seruing Masse, The father which was Reader, and his fellow studients, wondring at the litle time he had for studie, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse whith he made, asked of him, what the rule and order was which he obserued? But he was so far from thinking well of him selfe, that he iudged him selfe to be one of the most ignorant, and not worthie to weare S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis habit.</p>
                     <p>After his course in Philosophie, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father Generall, made him a preacher, in which charge he discouered that zeale, that his wordes enkindled the fire of deuotiō, in the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen &amp; hard hartes of many persōs that were eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of pietie. He preached not long, or rather, not at all, during his first abode in Religion, because imediatly after his permission, he was constrained to goe forth: but after his returne, hauing taken some time to make a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of him selfe, and a true attonement betweene God and his owne soule, he began to labour with such courage in so holie a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that forgetting the feeding of his owne bodie, he shewed him selfe infatigable, to serue to his neighbours the foode of their soules.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:176965:70"/>
                     <p>His first publique assaies were in Paris, in the church of the Capucins, and after at S. Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, S. German of Auxetrois, S. Andrew of Arcs, and thorough all the best citties of the kingdome of France, were his auditors did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes depart from him, with great applause &amp; admiration. He had a particular grace of God, to moue mens harts to a true feeling of their sinnes, which they did witnes by their bitter teares and change of life. God him selfe only knoweth, how many sinfull soules he conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the true pathe of their saluation, and what a number intimidated with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods seuere iudgments, left their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchednes, and are couered with saccloth in holie cloisters!</p>
                     <p>There are some of his exhortations yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant vnder his owne hande, wherin are to be seene so goodly discourses, so eleuated concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so liuely characters of a Seraphicall zeale, that euen the most iudicious spirits can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reade his wordes, without a greate impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vertu, what then were they able to doe, being quickned with his owne spirit, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from his owne mouth? Surely they were as so many piercing arrowes, which did heale in wounding, and wound in healing; killing to the world, and quickning vnto IESVS-Christ, those who hearing them, gaue them entrie into their soules. <q rend="inline">O my bretheren, said he (explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these wordes of the Apostle S. Paul to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:176965:71"/> Colossians 3. <hi>Despoiling your selues of the olde man with his actes</hi>) what meane we that we doe not despoile our selues, and put off our olde gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if we will be cloathed with royall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? If a Kinge should make this offer to a poore man, put off thy vile and base apparel, &amp; put on myne, were not such an on a foole, who would not part with his apparell, to put on such as were so noble? So fareth it with vs, who are cloathed with the old man, and you see, that God will clothe vs with him selfe: he will make vs kinges, more then kinges, yea euen Gods: he will clothe vs with his diuine will, if we, wretches that we are, doe nor contradict him: if at the houre of our death, he finde vs cloathed with other ragges woe be vnto vs.</q> These wordes are they not so many sparkles of holie fire? which how powerfull and fruitfull they were, the very effects them selues doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently testifie. For there were certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at this sermon, who an irreconciliable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie held so diuided, to the detriment of their owne soule, and notable scandale of their neighbour, that no sort of consideration could reconcile them, who at the departure from one of his sermons, embraced one another, and swore eache to other perpetuall amitie.</p>
                     <p>Further more, where he vnderstood of any quarrels and factions, betwene persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, he was very diligent to quench those flames, and makeing them to know the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:176965:71"/> of their, disordered passions, reduced them to reason; wherby God was glorified, and the state receiued benefit by the vnion of peace which ensued theron wherupon dependes its whole preseruation. In this point he was a true follower of S. Francis, for an Author of his time, who assureth to haue heard him prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at Bolognia on the day of the Assumption of our blessed lady, anno 1620. sayeth, that in all his sermons he principally aymed at this marke, to wit, to extinguish the fires of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to renew the alliances of happie peace: adding, that God gaue so great efficacie vnto his wordes, that he appeased such a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of quarrells and factions amongst the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as was sufficient to haue set the whole common wealth all on fire, if the effects had accompanied their designes.</p>
                     <p>And to the end that God might concurre with his labours in preaching, he had alwaies in his minde the wholesome speeches of S. Francis, who said, that that preacher is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, who destroyeth and corrupteth by his bad life, that which him selfe built and founded by the truth of his doctrine. Wherfore, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first with him selfe, &amp; redoubling his owne mortifications, neuer went vp into the pulpit, but first disciplining him selfe, with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie violence, wherof the blood which drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped downe was a faithfull witnesse, knowing well that it auaileth litle or nothing to teache
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176965:72"/> others, and not to put in practise the pointes them selues. Not content to castice him selfe thus seuerely, he shut the windowes of his chamber, and speaking to God from the depth of his hart in this obscuritie, he spent an hour in meditation vpon the point he was to speake, humbly beseeching the assistance of heauenly grace, for the performāce of that worke, to Gods glorie, and to the profit of his hearers soules.</p>
                     <p>This holie custome of meditation, besides the power which it had to stir vp mens hartes, produced yet on other fruite, which cannot be valued by any, but by those, who make profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there of: for by this meanes he got a great facilitie, to be able to speake of any matter that occasion might present, if he were aduertised therof but one houre before. And although this might in part be attributed to the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his wit, yet doutles it proceeded princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally from his holie meditations, as waters purified within a holy limback, and dropping sweetly downe from the fountaine head of so pure a soule, to which the holy Ghost com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it selfe after a maner knowen only to those who are partakers of the same.</p>
                     <p>This not withstanding did not hinder him, that he applyed him selfe vnto his studies, as often as his other occupations did permit him, but the great desire he had to cooperate to the health of soules, did much robbe him of these particular colloquies, God him selfe, for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176965:72"/> whom only he laboured with such affection, rendred him the recompence, by giuing him the knowledg of sundry thinges in a short time. For amongst the thinges which he hated most, it shewed that ignorance was one of the chiefest, taking his motiue from the threatning of God, thundered out in the Prophet Isay against his people saying. <hi>The cause why my people are led away prisoners, is for that they had not knowledg.</hi> Marke I pray you, how he discourseth vpon this point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">He doth not say, for hauing robbed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adulterie, or idolatrie, but he goeth to the fountaine and first cause of all euill, <hi>for that they had not knowledge.</hi> This truly is a terrible sentence, but reason confirmes it; for a man is a reasonable creature, as you know, and capable of reason and discourse, different in this from beastes, who depriued of reason, are guided only by the instinct of nature, which is the cause that what they doe, they doe by necessitie, and naturall inclination: but man being reasonable, instinct alone doth not suffice him, but he must haue reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to conduct him, for which cause it is that he goeth discoursing from principles to conclusions, and saith as followeth. All thinges that are good, are to be done: this is good, this therfore is to be done. Againe, All euil is to be fled: this is euill, this therfore is to be eschued. The will (as you know) is a power,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176965:73"/> which of it selfe is blinde, which knoweth nothing, but as it receiueth light from the vnderstanding, therfore, <hi>non fertur nisi in praecog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> it cannot loue good, nor hate euill, vnlesse it know it, it cannot worke this, nor auoide that, vnlesse it first loue or hate it, whence it cometh to passe, that if it be bound to worke that which is good, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke it, vnlesse it first loue it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue it, vnlesse it know it, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know it with out science. Ther fore by this connexion <hi>à primo ad vltimum,</hi> from the first to the last, knowledg is necessarie to doe good, and to flie euill. And for as much as our end is supernaturall, it sufficeth not a Christian to haue some science or naturall knowledge, such as the philosophers had, but there is a far more eminent knowledge required of him, which is that of faith &amp; of the holie Scriptures.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And them endeuoring to shew, what this knowledge ought to be, without the which we are not in the true path that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

The second, as a Christian. The third, as a Religious man. The fourth, as such a Religious man, to wit, Clarke, lay, simple Priest, or preacher. In all these estates a man hath neede of knowledge, but with this diuersitie; for in the first, as man it sufficeth that he know what naturall reason doth dictat to him, good &amp;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:176965:73"/> euill, to embrace the one, and to fly the other. In the second degree, as a Christian, he is bound to know the law of God, his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and those also of his church, the Articles of faith, with other ordinarie points of Christian doctrine. In the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as a religious man, he ought to know all thinges aforsaid, and moreover he ought to know the obligations and precepts of his rule, with other thinges appertayning to a true spirituall lyfe, other prayers, or deuotiōs. In the fourth degree, as such a religious mā, he ought to know the thinges which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto his office: yf he be a lay brother, the Christian doctrine, the precepts, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollences of his rule, thinges spirituall, and those in particular, which appertaine vnto a lay brother. If a Clarke, he ought to know both all this, and moreouer to say his office. If a simple priest, he ought to know cases of conscience, vnderstand the Summistes, and the matter of the Sacraments. If a Preacher, he ought to vnderstand, and know how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat the holy Scripture, and to haue skill in diuinitie. Briefly, euery one ought to rendar an account of those thinges which doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto his office, and consequently euery one ought to acquit hymselfe of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge according to the degree of his estate.

                     <p>And a litle after, speaking of S.

S. Francis saith as much in those few wordes, as all the spirituall bookes can say in the whole world. For in these wordes are contayned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, all the perfection of the spirituall virtues, which may be desiered in a passager of this life, <hi>to haue the Spirit of our Lord,</hi> that is to say, to be made one in spirit, &amp; in will, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his holy operatiō, to wit, his loue: foras he loues hym selfe, so likewise will he that we loue him this is our principall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this is our last and finall end, wherby we haue forsaken the worlde, together with all what soeuer we haue, our selues, our

This if we haue not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto this present, or at the least yf we desire not to obtaine it, and doe not enforce our selues hereunto aboue all thinges else what soeuer, in vaine it is, that we be entred into religion, in vaine it is, that we haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the worlde in vaine it is that we weare these contemptible habits. and in vaine yt ys, that we call our selues, brother Minors.

                     <head>Of his humilitie. THE TENTH CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>AS in a building well ordained, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ought to be laid, before the other parts can be raised, as it wheron all the other parts haue their subsistance and dependance: euen so in the spirituall building of the soule, where all the virtues make but one frame of sanctitie, for the secure lodging therof in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rest, humilitie as the basis and foundation, must first be laid, and serue for the raising and strengthning of all virtues. For this cause, this blessed father vsed great care and solicitude to acquire this virtu, not ignorant, that the meanes to be exalted, is first to be abased, and that vaine and vnprofitable is his paines, who without humilitie. thinketh to passe vnto other virtues; euen as yf he sowed in the ayre, and cast ashes against the winde, seeing that one of the chiefe and principall workes of God is, to depresse the exalted, &amp; exalt the depressed, casting those into the depth of nothing, and carying vp these so much higher in glorie, as they abased them selues in the nothing of their owne knowledg.</p>
                     <p>First therfore, I will not say that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie humble, for that being issued forth of so noble a familie, and for that of a Duke
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:176965:75"/> and Peere of France, he became a beggar; of rich, poore; and of one high in Court, abased into an order, where the actions of this holy virtues, seeme infamous, reproachefull, &amp; ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to those, who measuring all thinges by outward appearance, raise not vp the eyes of their vnderstanding, according to the measure of the sanctuarie, from whence they hope to receiue the honor and esteeme which is due vnto them. I will not call hym humble, in that liuing in great account he became dead to the world with our lord and Redeemer; No, for albeit such thinges of these ar most remarkable, yet this were to speake too generally, and many in these thinges might haue surpassed hym, sith yt ys in the power euen of kinges them selues, to renounce their crownes and all mōdanities. I will not (I say) exalt his humilitie by such actes as these, but by such as by a special grace from God shined in hym particularly. As, in that he esteemed hym selfe the least of all, and willingly gaue place to the very least, yea it was noted in hym particularly, that hauing many times bene Gardian, Prouinciall, and Definitor, and borne other charges in his order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, yet was he neuer seene to conuerse or deale with his inferiors, otherwise then yf he had bene theire equall or inferior, bearing alwayes fixed in this minde, that excellent sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Saint Francis (and allso teaching it to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176965:76"/> others) that <hi>a man is such, as he is in the knovvledg and loue of God: and nothing more</hi> that ys to say, that the glorie which we ought to seeke, doth not arise from the estimarion which men doe make of vs, but from the degre of perfection which we haue acquired, and which is written in the booke of lyfe. For proofe wherof, he cited the wordes of our B. Sauiour (Luc. 14) who commandeth vs, that when we are called into any place, to choose to our seluēs the lower Rome. Vpon which passage he writeth thus. Is yt not enough that I set m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For which cause reputing hym selfe vnworthie of all charge he ommit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not for all this to accept them ioyfullie and with hūble resignation of hym selfe, knowing that being elected, yt ys Iesus Christ who saith vnto hym. <hi>Amice ascende superius.</hi> Friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Whosoeuer, I say, had seene him, would he not haue bene much astonnished, &amp; constrained hy the force of truth to confesse, that the grace of God is a powerfull lessō vnto that soule, which listneth with attention, and with desire to put it in practise? But notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>andsting this is nothing, in comparison of many of his other actions, for this was secret, &amp; seene only of his other bretheren, who did the like when their turne came: but many other were done in the face of the Court, euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of Paris, wher he had formerly liued and beene seene, with much more honor and worldlie splendor then cā be spokē; In so much that, making on a time an allusion of his life present, with that which was past, and likewise of this, with all other religious persons, he cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to the great tree which Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noser saw, whose branches couered all with leaues filled it with their shadow, vntill such time as a voice was heard from heauen, which gaue commandment to cut doune the tree, &amp; to leaue only the roote therof, fastned to a stake of iron, that it might be moystned with the dew of heauen, adding this that followeth by way of demand vnto hymselfe.</p>

                     <p>One day, as the winter cold was most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, so that euen the best and warmest clothed, were forced to beg heate of the fire: sundrie poore Irish people asking almes at end of S. Michaels bridge in Paris, were faine to make a litle fire to resist the rigour of the cold, in expecting the charitie of those that passed. The blessed father Angell, coming frō dooing some worke of pietie, almost halfe dead with very cold being loth to enter into any house to warme him selfe, as too well knowen and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored euery where, warmed him selfe with this poore people: which those who passed too and fro well considering, and seeing the good father to warme his feete all frozen with cold at so poore a fire of three or four coales lighted by these poore people, did wonder thereat, and sundry of them, not without the shedding of teares. For all his desire was, to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176965:78"/> hide the greatnes of gis house, and the ranck he had somtimes held in the world, not a litle offended with those who came to visit him, if he saw they rather came of curiositie, then of some pious designe wherby God might be honored, and their neighbour edified.</p>
                     <p>The first time that he was sent vnto Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse, where he had left his habit, the principall of all the cittie, purposed to goe out to meete him, and to entertaine him, not in qualitie of a Capuchin, but of a noble lord of that familie, to which the whole contrie was obliged for their conseruation. As soone as he had notice hereof, and coming late vnto the towne, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by another gate then was expected, and so came secretly vnto his conuent. Wherat they being much astonished, went the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to offer him their at the conuents seruice; but coming thither they were more amazed then they were before, when they found him in the garden seruing the Masons, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hauing thanked them, and entertayned them but a very litle while, he returned againe vnto his former exercise, wherin he testified by his paines, that he tooke more pleasure therin, then in giuing eare to their offers of so great affection, which had for their obiect, his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and his merits: for he had quite exiled all worldly honors, both out of his desire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, esteeming no more of praise then
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176965:78"/> of reproche. And as a dead body, hath no fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of what is done vnto it, neuer murmuring nor complayning in what posture soeuer one doth place it: euē so he being dead to his owne interest, to his senses, and his passions, had so buried his affections in the open side of Iesus Christ vpon the Crosse, that nothing in the whole wordle could affect him with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only the beautie of virtu, together with the grace of God, was of power to make him ioyfull in posessing it, and to make him sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when according to the violence of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires he could not put it in practise as he wished. Yea, he alwayes bore that minde, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer hungar and thirst, and to endure the affrontes and iniuries of many cold Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in concealing his name and familie, then to receiue all kinde of curtesies, by reuealing the house from whence he descended.</p>
                     <p>Vpon a time as he visited the prouince of Picardy being ouer taken by the night, he was constrained to goe to a Castle to aske if of their charitie, they would vouchsafe to lodge him &amp; his companion for that night. And albeit that his grace full countenance ad liuelie grauitie, did sufficiently shew to those that beheld him, that he had somtimes bene some man of worth, yet the master of the lodging being of the pretended religiō (which seemeth to beare a particular hate to religious persons) droue
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176965:79"/> them away, with all maner of reproachfull &amp; iniurious wordes, which passion and malice could almost inuent. This blessed father, who knew not what it was to reply with sharpnes vnto such reproaches, prest with the night, in a coūtrie vnknowen, without penny or half pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all naked, encompassed with many incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and danger of his health, if he should be forced to lye in the open ayre, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him with all the instance that a poore religious man might in such a case, that he would only put into some place, where they might but stand drie, assuring him that they would no way be troublesome to him, and that God would reward him for so great a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This gentleman notwithstanding, (more insensible then a stone,) was not moued one whit at his piteous complaints and humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and refusing them all entrie into his house, only suffered them to retyre them selues into a stable, which was vncouered in such sort, that he could not lodge his beastes therin.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this his incommodious lodging, he encouraged his companion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in our Sauiour Iesus Christ, representing vnto him, the vsuall wordes of their holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Frācis, saying, that he tooke much more confort to be loaden with iniuries and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries, then he did to heare his owne prayses to be published. As soone as the day brake, they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176965:79"/> departed forth of this stable, which they had made a chappell of prayer and deuotion; and being set forward on their way, they began to wonder, when they saw one come galloping after them as fast as he could, douting lest some greater harme was toward them. But this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because that some, who had met these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their way, and knowing well this B, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had told his name vnto this gentleman, and from what house he was descended, yet nether knowing where he had bene harboured nor what entertaynment had bene giuen him.</p>
                     <p>This gētleman not knowing whar to thinke of him selfe, very sorrie for his fault, and much admiring so great patience and humilitie, got vp on horse-back, and hauing ouertaken them, instantly alighted downe, fell on his knees, and askt him forgiuenes, excused him selfe that he did not knowe him, earnestly besought him to returne to his house, wherin all that was, was at his seruice, that so at the least he might make some part of amendment for his former fault: with sundry other such like wordes, which the sorrow conceiued for his former fault, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with respect to ciuile honestie, might sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest vnto him. The B. Father kindly thanked him for his curtesie, and reasoning with hym a litle while concerning his religion, at the last he left him, cōtenting himselfe with the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se he made him to forsake his heresie, and to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176965:80"/> embrace the light of the Catholique, Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and Roman faith: which promise the gentleman performed presently after, to the glorie of God, and to the saluation of his owne soule.</p>
                     <p>Neuer should I make and end, if I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all his actions, in the exercise of this so rare a virtu, and how many soules he constrayned, in a maner, by this sweete meanes, to forsake Sathan, to issue forth of the sinke of their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to conuert them vnto God; For euen as balme and other aromaticall spices, being stamped &amp; reduced to poudre, are more sweet to smell to, then they were before being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brused: euen so the vertues of man, are more aggreable vnto God, &amp; atract others with the more violence, when being brused and poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their humilitie, they cause a sweet and pleasing odor to euaporat from them, by their practise.</p>

                     <head>Of his Patience. THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>AFter his humilitie, I will set in order in the second place, his great patience, partly because almightie God doth alwayes exercise the humble by this way, partly also because of the affinitie and coniunction that there ys betwixt these two virtues, which ys such, that hardly can they be separated asunder: for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie causeth vs to cherishe abiection, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience conforteth vs in the same: true humilitie loues contempt, and patience takes content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein: so that the one and the other hauing the same obiect, haue but this difference which doth seperate thē, that humilitie maketh that a man, although contemned and set at naught, yet replyeth not, nor doth apprehend yt: contrariwise, patience knoweth how to helpe yt selfe, but will not serue yt selfe of its owne power, and chooseth rather, to suffer wronge, then to offer any, which ys indeed the true touchstone to discerne one truly humble of hart and of affection, and to discouer all sort of forced &amp; false hipocrisie, which slydeth into such actions. For it is an easie matter, to weare a poore and a patched habit, to goe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, the head abased, the eyes mortified, to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176965:81"/> reuerence our equalls, giue place to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, when the action is not of importance: but to endure an iniurie, a contēpt or disgrace, or other sort of indignitie, with a smiling and chearfull countenance, without shewing yt outwardlie, or feeling inwardly any kinde of discontentment, without all dout such a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience clearly sheweth, that humilitie lodgeth within that soule, and both the one and the other of these virtues, rendre yt perfect and compleate.</p>
                     <p>This blessed father, exceeded in both these singular virtues true witnesses of the inward peace and trāquilitie of his soule. For as he one day came from Venise, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Reuerend Father Generall. to be Gardien in the contry of Loraine, the warres being still in their former furie, at his entrie into Frāce, he was taken by the soldiars, who vsed hym very despitefully, stript hym of his habit, and loading hym with abuses and with blowes, called hym traitor, hipocrite, spye to bewray them, and one who had taken that habit, the better to couer his pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, vnder this exteriour pretext of false dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulatiō, and dissembled falsitie: searched hym from top toe, to see yf he had no letters about him, &amp; tore in pieces certaine papers which they founde: &amp; whilest some thus busied thēselues for to search hym, others haled hym,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176965:81"/> and pulled him by the bearde, with many like reproachfull abuses. The blessed Father all this while carried himselfe, as a meeke lambe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking a worde, or makinge shewe of any feelinge, exposed his body to the rage, and furie of these barbarous fellowes, who not content with this, led him from thence vnto their garrison, a good way distant from that place, where in the middest of them all, as an innocent lambe amongst wolues, they made their sport, and pastime of him somtimes moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him with ridiculous wordes, sometimes with iniuries, obiecting vnto him the hipocrisie of his habit, the falsitie of his faith, and calling him superstitious foole, and eater, &amp; deuourer of his god: still betwixt whiles beatinge him, &amp; buffeting him with their fistes.</p>
                     <p>O blessed soule, who hast here founde a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, with the paines of thy lord, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, after which thou so ernestly soughtest, and aspirest.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176965:82"/> more neerely in his holy sufferinges he craued, and demanded pardon for them who blinded in their error, imposed vpon him these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull iniuries; for it is the propertie of a soule, which is allwayes vnited by loue vnto her God, to conuert, like vnto bees, all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, into sweetenes, to make thereof, the hony of glorie, esteeminge all that which affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth her, for tranquillitie and solacing her selues amidst such sufferances; pray for those vnto our lord, who serue as instruments, to make proofe of her constancie,</p>
                     <p>These companions passed ouer the whole day in such like actions full of inhumanitie: and the night being come, which forced them to retire themselues, they being weary with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictinge him, left him to the open fieldes, that so also he should be afflicted for want of lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge. In this sort he went for a while with his companion through a thicke, and woody forrest, and seeinge, that the souldiers had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, besides his breuiary, and other papers, their obedience, he encouraged his companion, to goe backe againe, vnto the place where the souldiers were, and not to leaue them till first they had restored it againe vnto them for els quoth he, we shall not be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when we come to the conuent of our bretheren. They returned therfore, and with many instances, and piteous supplications able to rent the hearts of stones, they recouered at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176965:82"/> the last their obedience.</p>
                     <p>The weather at that time was very sharpe, &amp; the trauells which they had indured that day without eatynge any thinge, hauinge greatly weakened his bodily forces, he durst not go on his iourney in the darke, in a way which he had neuer went, for feare of fallnige into some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hole, and to finde a lodginge he had no hope. At the last a poore sheepecoate offered it selfe to his necessitie, which entringe into with his Companion, they passed ouer that whole night, in prayers, and deuine prayses, weary of the way, but exceedinge ioyfull in their soules, thus to haue suffered for the loue of God. Who can chuse but admire at this great patience? and what heart is so hard, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that there was some certaine grace hidden in these holy actions, wherewith almightie God doth beatifie his frindes, causinge their greatest difficulties, to become easy, and full of glory!</p>
                     <p>In this blessed father doutles, was seene to be renewed the first feruour of Saint Frauncis, and of his companions who leaden with Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and others opprobries in diuerse countries where they came, as men vnknowen, and of none account, vnder a poore habit, and full of abiection, tooke all kinde of contentment in such like sufferances, and inflamed with the loue of heauen, like two celestiall Salamanders, tooke their nourishments amidst the flames of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176965:83"/> these afflictions. One of the greatest motiues, which this blessed father had to bringe him to possesse so great a patience, besides the exemple of our sauiour himselfe, was the promise of a recompence, citinge these wordes. <hi>Noli timere, quia redemi te, &amp; vocaui te nomine tuo.</hi> Feare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue redeemed thee, and called thee by thy name.

There is no difference, but this, betwixt the on martirdome, and the other that the first is bought by the price of bloud, and so is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and manifest, the other is hidden within the closett of an amorous hart, and is only
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176965:84"/> knowen to god, from whom he expecteth his crowne. Then giue me leaue to speak of this blessed Martyr Father Angel, all whose life, was nothing els but a lingering death, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Martyrdome sufferinge labour, cold, heate, hunger, want, haire Cloth, discipline, &amp; other mortifications of the bodie; and that which is more hard, the corrections of the heart, which in the world had in nothinge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to true religious perfections, and to sustaine all thinges, without any signe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, or murmuring, whatsoeuer was enioyned him by his superiours. For proofe of his humility, and penance, which is all most an insupportable torture to corrupted nature which playes the rebell, with which corruptiō, we are all infected as the sonnes of Adam, and principally great, and noble persons, who thinke they be borne to command others, &amp; not to submitt their necks with patience vnder the yoke of a rude, and peremptory obedience. So that he was among his bretheren, as a true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or image, in which they did consider the patience of our sauiour liuely represented, which he did practise, with so much Zeale, that in his greatest sicknesses, suffrances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of feelinge affliction, he did shewe most ioy and contentment, so full was he of the spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is spoken in their rule, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it he sayd a religious man was emptie,

The reason is, that things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are not sufficient to fill the soule, but god only, and his spirit: how shall we knowe it? euen as we knowe a vessell of wine, whether it be full, or emptie. If in touchinge it, it maketh a great sound, and noise it is emptie, if not, it is full. So touch a Christian, a good religious man by some tribulation, or penance, if he make a great outcry, and be much troubled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, it is an argument that he wanteth the spirit of god. But when he is full, touch him as much as you will you shall heare no noise, noe murmuringe, noe complaninge.

                        <q rend="inline">THere are two things (said this Blessed Father) in an exhortation which he made to his bretheren, which haue the first place in euery good Religion, which do giue it life, forme and perfection, without
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176965:86"/> which, Religion is but fraud, hipocrisie, and superstition. The outward, and inward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, the corporall and mentall By the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I vnderstand all thinges which belonge to compose the bodie, to witt, fasting, vocall praiers, discipline, watching handy labours, a poore and ill bed, a rude habit. And by the inward, I vnderstand whatsoeuer belongeth to the reforminge of the spirit, and soule, to witt mentall prayer, humblenes of hart, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of spirit, puritie of intention, recollection, in fine the exercise of all vertues: of these two the outward is as the bodie of religion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is as the soule. And as a man which hath but a soule without a body cannot be called a man, so religion which regardeth only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and not the outward, cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led religion. And as a man with a body without a soule, is noe more a man, because that is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, which giueth him life: so Religion with the only outward shewe, is not religion, but a dead bodie. Therfore the outward, and inward exercise, make religion perfect.</q>

                        <q rend="inline">These are the two alters, which god pointed out in figure, in his temple. The altar of brasse, where the flesh of diuerse creatures was sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and the altar of gold, where the sweete incense was burnt. The first was named the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Holocaust, and was more open, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: the other the altar of incense, some what more close, and secret: which gaue vs to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176965:86"/> vnderstand, two sorts of operations, which god doth require of vs, in his holy seruice, the outward, and inward. The first Altar where the body, and the flesh is sacrificed with the rest is mortification, and penance, and this is exposed to the eies of men. The second altar where the spirit is offered to god, with the fire of loue, as a most sweete incence, is more secrett. The Apostle Saint Paul expresseth these two sorts of sacrifices, and workes, sayinge. <hi>I beseech you, that ye giue your bodies a liuinge sacrifice, holy. and pleasing to god, your resonable seruice</hi> In bidding vs to offer our bodies in sacrifice to god, and that a liuinge sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he sheweth the first sort of sacrifice to be a worke of penance, and mortification, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to the outward man: and addinge that this offeringe be holy, and pleasing to god, &amp; a reasonable seruice, he sheweth the second sort of sacrifice, and the vertues which belonge to the inward man: as puritie of intention, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of spirit, cleannes of hart, resignation &amp;c. because without these things, our seruice is not reasonable, but rather fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Therfore my bretheren let vs who are called to the seruice of god in so high an estate of life, if we will satisfie our duty and profession, not content our selues with one of these parts, but let vs ioyne them both together, least otherwise we labour in vaine: let vs not content our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, to offer vp our bodies for a liuinge sacrifice, but let vs offer him also, both soule, and hart, so

                     <p>O admirable discourse for such as know how to comprehend the same! in howe fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, doth he comprehend all the perfections necessary to a religious soule, which by the vowes of pouertie, &amp; Chastitie doth consecrate to god, all that wich apperteineth to the body; and by that of obedience, all that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the soule: and within the circuit of these three, is found comprised all that which god can require, and which a soule can perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the practise of the Euangelicall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells. Which counsells the blessed Father hauing allwaies for his Butt in his actions, it is no meruaile if he speake of to great thinges. For he spoke of this as a man who knewe by practise what he said, the best lesson that any deuine can giue. For beinge once inrolled to serue vnder the standard of the crosse, he toke allwayes great contentment in the practise of obedience. He shewed himselfe ignorant to command, but to obey, he surpassed all others in this science. This was the ballance by which he weighed all his actions, whether they caried that weight that god requireth. For he knewe well, that a religious person cannot erre, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he doe in obeying his superiours, so that it be not contrarie to his vowes, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and his Church. where vpon being to giue a definition of this vertue, he said, that it is an extacie of the loue of God,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176965:87"/> which putteth a man out of him selfe by a denyall of his owne will, not suffering him to be any more for him selfe, but for God his beloued.</p>
                     <p>O blessed, and happy extasie, o extasie of great meritt! To this is that sayinge of his, very conformable; that a Religious man that did any action for any other designe, then for the loue of God simply, and for obedience, was a false Religion, and possessed with an ill spirit. that all his actions, as fastings, discipline, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

That such a man was like to a horse which had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his halter, yet trayning it is taken by the first that meeteth him: so a religious man who doth not obey with promptnes and feruour of spirit, is taken by his first master the Deuill, being out of the way of saluation, and in the way of perdition, if he doe not open the eies of his spirit to remember his promise. He cited for proofe of this a place of holy Scripture (which he had well read) where the people lamenting that they had fasted, afflicted their bodies, and humble their soules, but that God would not looke vpon them, nor heare their Cry. God answereth them in few wordes that which a good Religious person ought to call to mind. <hi>Behold in the day of your fast there was your owne proper will.</hi> But so farr was the blessed Father in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his owne will, that he held his Superiours

Whosoeuer will enter into this Conuent, let him humble himselfe to her, and do reuerence to her. Let him conferr with her, for she is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of all. And allthough she seemeth to be old, for she hath not a faire outward aspect, as some others, as Austeritie of life, prayer, and preaching, yet let him auouch her, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generall, or Prouinciall of the loue of God hath giuen her the charge of Prioresse: enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not the others till you haue her license, for all the other obey, and serue her.

Prudence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth her, for there is noe greater prudence then to preferre the iudgement of our Prelate before our owne. Iustice obeyeth her: for in obeyinge our Prelate, we paye a debt to which we oblige our selues by vowe in our profession. Temperance obeyeth her, for a true obedient man doth not only temper his outward senses, and sensuall appetites, but which is more, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth him selfe most in his owne iudgement, and will.

All excellent workes do serue her euen Matyrdome it selfe, which if it be not suffered by a pure obedience to our Prelate, and God, it is of no meritt.

                     <p>O blessed obedient soule, sithence thou hast put thy selfe into the handes of God, he will crown thee with honor, and glory in this world, and will giue thee the Diademe of an eternall kingdome in the world to come: soe that thou shalt haue two Crownes as a great Queene, the first in the militant Church, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176965:89"/> the second in the triumphant. Thou shalt noe more be called the forsaken, and forlorne of thy spouse. For thou shalt abound in heauenly, and deuine consolation, but thou shalt be called by a new name, and glorious aboue others; Thou shalt be called my will. As those that are comprehensours, that is, those that haue ended their voiage are happy in doinge the will of God in heauen, so the pillgrims, and waifairing men are happy in their manner, in doing it on earth. Whence it commeth to passe, that the earth becommeth a Paradise, and man an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, &amp; a Pillgrim is become a comprehensour, that is an enioyer of rest after his trauell. See then the great dignitie of this vertue of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which is the first of all vertues; the first in esteeme of gouernement, in authoritie, and in meritt, what can be said more? This is the vertue, which serueth for boundes, and limitts to reteine, and keepe in, a multitude of others, which otherwise get out of the window of their own will, euen those which had made a great marchandize of vertues, &amp; therfore it made the Father amiable to his companion, officious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbour, sober in all meetings, plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his superiours; victorious ouer all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, Charitable to the afflicted, content in all occasion, chearefull in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Religion, a subduer of his passions, and absolute master of his affections, and by a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler grace which God doth not giue but to his

                     <p>He then made comparison betweene the world, and Religion, and consideringe that the world holdeth it a most heauy crosse to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the will of an other. As for me (saith he) beinge moued with an extraordinary good spiritt) I thinke with Saint Francis, that this is a soueraine contentment, and comfort. I will obey (sayth he) euen to death, not only the Pope my Superiour sett ouer me, Generall, or Prouinciall, but any Gardiane that it shall please him to giue me, and I will do nothinge against his will, because he is my master.

If I goe to the table, if I do any seruice in the Conuent, I will goe, and do all in obedience, yea, yea, this is it which our Father S. Francis would say when he put himselfe in his rule to obserue

                     <p>I will not recite many of his particuler actiōs in proofe of his spirit, and desire of pouertie, I will only by the way speake how beinge at Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me at the Generall Chapter; the Pope not a little wondringe at his eminent vertue, after he had testified his holy, and fatherly affection for the conseruation, and in maintenance of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, asked him what he would require of him for his owne perticuler. He made this answer, which astonished those that were present. <hi>Holy Father, I demand nothing but your holy Benediction, to obtaine Gods holy grace to keepe the pouertie that I haue vowed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Chastitie was no lesse remarckable, he was chaste in his discourse, in his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in his thoughts, in his affection, and as it is a great vertue to absteine from one pleasure after we haue tasted the sweetnes of it, then to depriue out selues of it before we haue once tryed it: so was chastitie more excellent, &amp; more commendable in him, seeing that in the spring of his age, in the noone of his youth, he bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled himselfe from all sort of those allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after he had liued some yeares in holy, &amp; lawfull marriage. His eies, by which the enemy getteth into the soule, were so mortified, That as he went abroad, the hemme of his habitt was as the Orizon of his sight, for seldome did
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:176965:94"/> he lift vp his eies higher and in this kind of mortification, his soule (retired from all kind of obiects) did entertaine it selfe with God, in whom he placed his whole delight.</p>
                     <p>He compared a man that is curious in seeinge, to a painter, who beinge to drawe some pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat, first beholdeth it well, and afterward fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an idea, or forme of it in his imagination, accordinge to, which he fashioneth his image, And indeed (sayth he) we are painters who lookinge curiously vpon obiects before our eies, we conceaue the forme of them in our spiritts, and haue much a doe afterwards to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face it, and raize it out, and we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>oculus tuus depraedatus est animam.</hi> Thy eie hath spoyled thy soule, and death hath entred by the windowe. For desires proceede first from the sight, and these are they which infuse dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly infection into the soule. His wordes were so chast, that when he was to reproue impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he had that particuler grace of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse himselfe so modestly, and powerfully that he moued those which were farr drenched in lasciuiousnes, and lewdnes, to a bitter remorse, with sheddinge many teares. His face was a glasse of grauitie, and allwaies represented modestie, and gracefull honestie. All laughture, &amp; affected gestures of curious wordlings, were farre from him.</p>
                     <p>To be briefe, he had all the good qualities, which are preseruatiues of so precious puritie,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176965:94"/> For if sobriety profiteth to this end, he was one of the most sober of his profession, cotentinge himselfe with herbes, and pults, or bread, and water, which was his ordinary foode. If labour, and trauaile helpeth, he abhorred idlenes as a Deuill. If the roughnes of habitt doth keepe downe the flesh, his was the most rude, that could be found. If scilence doth contribute to this, he was neuer seene to speake but when necessitie vrged him. If occasions, and places of danger are to be auoyded, he was so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to knowe them well before he aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there was no cause to feare any fall there by. Wherfore makinge benefitt of all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and raysinge himselfe hereby as it were an inuincible castle of defence, he liued allwayes in the straightnes of pouertie, which he cheris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in the desert of religion, vnder the gard, &amp; conduct of a faithfull Pastour, the Angell Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dien, and keeper of his life.</p>

                     <head>Of his feruour and deuotion. THE FOVRTEENTH CHAP.</head>
                     <p>DEuotion is nothinge els, but a prompte, and ready will, inflamed with a great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to serue God vpon all occasions whereas lukewarmnes, or coldnes which are borne with vs, hinder vs to followe our sauiour throughe the desertes of penaunce. But this is a feruour which inciteth vs to embrace the Crosse, not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176965:95"/> by a forced, but voluntary violence. Hereunto the delights, and ioies of heauen, serue for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to drawe vs on by a sweete constraint. This ardout, and burninge affection did so kindle this B. Father that it might well be thought, that rather some deuine spirit did worke those holy operations in him, then a humane soule, which is made dull, and heauie by the burden of the flesh which accompanieth it.</p>
                     <p>Of foure and twentie houres, in the day, he gaue more then twentie to God in diuerse actions of holines, and pietie, reseruinge but three, or foure for the repose, and rest of his feeble bodie. An houre reposed he: vpon a poore strawe bed, or vpon boordes, trussinge himselfe within his habitt, girt with his corde as in the day time: and so much the more hard it was for him to be able to endure this, because whilest he liued in the world he could not finde linnē fine enough, nor bed soft enough to repose in after his worldly occasion of busines. But as a little fire encreaseth, as fewell is put to it, &amp; breaketh out after into a dangerous firinge: so the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of religion being ioyned with his first pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did so augment the fire of his deuotion, that allthough he smothered it as much as he could, to conceale it, and hide it from the eies of men, yet the flame thereof did breake forth to the admiration of men, as the ioye thereof mounted to the blessed Angells in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Imagine (sayd he) one time a citie with two
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:176965:95"/> ports, by one which, all the riches, and tresure of the Citie did passe foorth, and by which the enemies enter in which should put all to fire, &amp; sword, and this is the gate of slouth, and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. There is another port, by which all the ill annoyances of the Citie goe foorth, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the enemies; by which enter all the reliefe, and succour of the same citie: and this is the port of deligence and feruour. What then is more detestable to a religious man then slouth, and lukewarme dulnes? and what is mote to be desired, and sought after then deligence? what monster more hideous, then to see a religious man cold, and negligent, and forgetfull of his vocation? which is a thinge odious in the sight of God, Angells, and men. On the contrary side what spectacle more admirable, then to see a religious man, diligent, deuout, feruent, and spirituall, which reioyseth God, Angells, and men.</p>
                     <p>This blessed Father said masse euery day, what busines soeuer he had, with that holy fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of the excellencie of these dreadfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, where our Sauiour IESVS-Christ, which died on the Crosse is offered a newe for, our necessities, which consideration wrought in him an extraordinary affection to this holy seruice, so that on day being in a voyage he wēt nine leagues in a morninge, which is 18. miles english, to the end to saye masse: which he presently sayde as soone as he ariued, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:176965:96"/> time to wipe away his sweate, nor wash his fete, accordinge to the custome of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins.</p>
                     <p>Another time being at Gaillon with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinall, he came frō thence very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morninge, to the end he might come to Rhouen, and dyne with the Religious, who fasted that day, with bread, and water, because it was the vigile of S, Francis, and the Gardien could not persuade him to take any other refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, after he was come nine leagues fastinge.</p>
                     <p>Speakinge of Deuotion, he said that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, but principally a religious man was like to a vinedresser which had agreed for the hire of his trauaile with the master of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which is God, And as it should not be meete for the vinedresser, in steade of labouring to run aside into a gaye medowe, and there spend his time in makinge of garlandes of the sweete flowers so should it be vnmeete for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious person, to lett any time passe without endeuoringe still to increase his meritts. And after this as a water, which breaketh the causey, or damme, which stayed it, he cryeth out citinge the words of S. Peter: <hi>Bretheren labour the more that yee may make sure your vocation, and election.</hi> It is not enough to haue begunne well, perseuere, and continue. It is not enough to haue done well in the yeare of our nouiceshipps, but we must continue after our profession: leese no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but reade allwayes, or write, or mediate, or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:176965:96"/> pray, or praise God either in an Actiue life, or contemplatiue.</p>
                     <p>Those heauenly fauours, and graces which he had by holy extasies and raps, he kept so clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, that no man can write any certaine hereof; notwitstanding it was easie for spirituall men, who haue the iudgement of discerninge it, to guesse by many outward signes that he wanted them not. For it is a thing almost impossible, that he could practise prayer, which so great holy violence, and continue it so long as he did, if after it God had not strenghthened him with some supernaturall force: &amp; the extraordinary ioye with which he was seazed a little before his death, did euidently shewe that it could not proceed but from a deuine rapt. From this fountaine of Deuotion sprang incredible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, and repose of Spirit. He was allwayes vnited with God he did all this closely within himselfe, and to God, and had no other will, or desire, but Gods, will, and pleasure, so that he had Gods holy spirit in an extraordinary measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: And what doth this spirit worke (sayde he) in man? It maketh him truly wise, iudicious, illuminated in the way of God: it maketh him full of knowledge, not of vaine, and emptie knowledge, but with the knowledge of the Saints: which is the knowledge of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It maketh him resolute, and well aduised in all doubtfull cases, it maketh him valiant in aduersities, pious, and deuout towards God and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:176965:97"/> his neighbour, fearefull with a filiall, and chaste feare, in fine it maketh him allwayes stand vpon his Gard.</p>
                     <p>Loe what it is to haue the spirit of our Lord: it is to giue full possession of himselfe to God, that he may gouerne, and conduct him, and dwell in him, giuinge him the keyes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresie. What are these keyes? to be willing, and not willing, to will that which God willeth, and not to will that, which he willeth not: doe ye knowe what it is to haue the spirit of God? to do all our actions, and workes with feelinge, feruour, and actuall intention, at the least, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall for the honor, and loue of God. If we do take our refection, to take it for the honor, and glory of God. If we sleepe, if we trauaile, if we preach, if we do our officie, or say our prayers, to serue God with loue, and feruour. This holy practise so vnited him to God, that he made vse of all creatures, as a ladder to mount vp to the contemplation of the Creator: so that whatsoeuer betided him good, or bad, his spirit was allwaies at rest, takinge all, as from the hand of God. Which cannot come, but from the cleare fountaine of a pure soule. For (I will speake this for those that are more spirituall) it is the propertie of a perfitt soule; the more it seemeth to be depriued of all grace, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God, and ouerwhelmed in miseries, so much the more to vnite it selfe to him by this meanes; knowinge by a certaine light of spirit,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:176965:97"/> that the graces which it first felt within it selfe, wherewith it was as it were made druncken by the abundance of them, that there are reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and drawen vp to the fountaine of them which is God, and that they are there assuredly, and better conserned then when the soule did tast of them, and hereby it receaueth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and comfort to see them in God, then in it selfe, and vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inge it selfe with God, seeketh them there as in their proper sonne. Hereby (I say) it leeseth all vnworthy things in desires, and transformeth it selfe into God, as much as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie frailty can attanie to. For as we haue no proprietie of our selfes, but by our will, when we come to quitt it, &amp; driue it from vs, we haue no other proprietie, but that which is of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">In this state of grace, and in this state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, was this good Father who speakinge of religion, said. Spoyle your selues, and leaue, what? Leaue all; it is not enough to leaue som what, our goods, our possessions, our counrie. No, all. It is not sufficient to leaue father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brethren, sisters, parents, and frinds, No, all. It is not enough to leaue our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, our commodities our delights of the world, and of the flesh. No, all things. All our euill habitts, and customes, all our euill desires, all our proper will, iudgement, sense knowledge. Therfore by our vowe which we make in religion, we giue our selues wholy to God, to the end that his deuine maiestie may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:176965:98"/> wholy, and perfitly possesse vs for his: so that he dispose of vs, as of a thinge that he holdeth in his handes, and that without any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or resistance of ours. For as among men, the dominion, and proprietie of any thing is transported from one to another: so by solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vowes which we make, we translate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and proprietie of our selues to God. And as amonge men there are in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, thinges left to another mans keepinge, donations, sales, commutations, and restitutions: so we may apply them to our deedes, what then shall we call it, a gage left to another mans trust, or keepinge? so S. Paul seemeth to call it, for as in a pledge or gage some thing is committed to one which keepeth it for a certaine time, and afterward restoreth it: so do we depriue our selues for a time of the vse of our will, and libertie, and we committ it to God, who will render it vs abundantly in another life: but yet ther is this difference, that the power, and disposition of the gage, is in him which gageth it, but we haue no such power in this: shall I call it then a donation, because we resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne our selues freely, and franckly to God? or a sale, because we do not giue it freely without recompence, but haue an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ternall reward for it? or may it be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, or change, for as much as we giue our selues to God, he giueth also himselfe to vs, and that with great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:176965:98"/> giuinge himselfe to vs immortall, beinge but mortall creatures, and giuinge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe infinite to vs, which are but finite, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe most blessed, and happy, to vs miserable, and wreched creatures. Finally all this may be, it may be called, a gage, a donation, a change, a sale, but it is more meete to call it a restitution. For we do but render to God that which is his; and it being both iust, and resonable that a man restore that which is an others, that which is his masters, least other wise we become theeues and robbers, I say it is more iust, and agreable to reason, to render to God that which is his with out keepinge it one moment, least we nicurre the penaltie, not only of theft, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, but of Sacriledge. Let therfore that which is Caesars, be rendred to Caesar, and that which is Gods to God; And how? let vs render bodies, soules, lifes, wills, both for their true essence, and profitt to God, to the end that the iustice, &amp; law of Iesus-Christ be accomplished. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further, that as auntiently there were two sorts of Sacrifice. In the one they burnt but one part of rhe sacrifice, and in the other, the whole was burnt, and consumed.

                     <p>In the greatest scruple and doubtes which were proposed, he would no other casuist but his rule: and twise when he was Prouinciall, and visited all the Conuents making two, or three exhortations (as his leasure permitted, and the

What art thou o Lord, and what am I, there was imparted to me a cleere light of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods maiestie, and of myne owne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therfore I sayd. O my Lord, what art thou? soueraingly wise, mighty, good who vouchsafest to visit me with so much charity, me a poore, and vile worme, yea an abysme of miseries. The mistery afterward of stretching out my hand three times is this. My Lord IESVS Christ speakinge sweetely to me sayd. Francis giue me some thinge. And I sayd to him. O Lord thou knowest that I am all thine, &amp; that I haue no other thing but this rust which I weare, on my backe, and this Cord with which I am girt, and these spings also are none of mine. what then can I giue to thee? Then our Lord sayd to him. Francis put thy hand into thy bosome, and offer me what thou shalt finde there, then he put his hand into his bosome, found a faire peece of gold, and being astonished art this he offered it to IESVS Chist. After a little respit our Lord spake so againe to him, and he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I haue nothinge, neither will haue any

What is meant by this? our Lord would signifie by these three pieces, the three wowes, and the obseruance of them, which is so acceptable to him, to witt obedience, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, Chastitie. This is monie, not of earth or of iron, but of gold, because it is precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: found in our bosome, that is in our free will, because if our vowes were not voluntary, they should not be pleasing to God: but the mony which God putteth in our bosome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was he which inspireth vs to offer them to him, and giueth vs grace to obserue them.

His bodie kept him downe to the earth, as the matter of fire doth suppresse it in part, but his affections did soare vp to heauen, as a flame of fire, doth to the proper Sphere. His vertues shined farr more by the cooperation of Charitie, for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was the seed of them, Charitie did nourish them, charitie as the vitall spirit, did giue them motion and life.</p>
                     <p>To speake of his Charitie towards God, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered that he was vnited to this deuine obiect in so straight bondes, that being wholy dead in his owne desires, he squared all his actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sole will of God, which is the only and vtmost point which maketh mens soules deuine, and transformed into God: He thought, meditated, spake, nor willingly heard any other speech, but of God. So that the cōsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the loue of God, which he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to his creatures in cloathinge himselfe with their frailtie, to restore them the inheritance
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:176965:104"/> which they had lost by their owne sinnes, rauis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed his spirit, and made him groane to be with in his opened side, that he might sucke from thence the milk of grace, after which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himselfe to pante and fainte, as though he were but a starueling for want of this foode.</p>
                     <p>The greife, and dolours which his master had endured for his sake, were so deepely imprinted in his soule, that in the greatest sufferinges, where the most perfitt would haue shewed themselfes to be sensible, he had all waies a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge for an example to some, and an obiect of admiration to others, was an infalliable argument of his inward contentment, and the signe of the straight vnion of his soule with God. This vnion did so occupie his soule in supernaturall thinges, that it caused him to forgett that feelinge which he did owe to the naturall man. In so much, that it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many that kewe him well, that without speciall grace, he had neuer ben able to subsist among the thornes of so many austerities, and mortifications. For it is incredible what little sustenance he gaue to his bodie, and how little rest he tooke, yet did he appeere in better plight for his health, then when he liued in the world, amidst all the delicacies which men of his rancke haue att their will. How often was he to be seen in the open countrey trauayling, and enduring all sort of bad weathers when his

The third is taken from the last

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:176965:107"/> charitie by workes and effectes, not by speech, nor by external appeerance: Bretheren let vs loue, not in word, nor tongue, but in worke, and truth. But what are the markes and effects? there are two principall. The first is, if we do keepe our selues from giuinge any offence, or doing any ill to our neighbour. The second is, if we force our selues to do all the good we can. S. Paul saith first, charitie worketh no ill, and next is benigne, and good: By the first we are bound to beare no hate, or malice towards our neighbour, not to iudge ill of him, not to murmur, or detract from his fame: not to iniury, calumniat him, or do him any harme: By the second we are bound to loue him, to iudge well of him, to helpe him in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, to visit, and serue him if he be sick, to pardon him if he hath offended vs, to correct him with charitie, if he hath committed any sinne. These are the signes, the effects, and the workes of a true, and brotherly charitie.</p>
                     <p>He visited the sick in an extraordinarie feruour, comforted them in their greatest dolours in that manner, that many which apprehended death as a cruell lyones, before they see her, did willingly, and valiantlie enter into the listes, and shewed no apprehension of this last combat. For he made this passage so happy for them in regard of the future rest, and the auoydinge of the miseries of this world.</p>
                     <p>A yeare before this blessed Father died: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigneur the Duke of Montpēsier his son in lawe,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:176965:108"/> payd his tribute to nature, in the floure of his age, being but of the age of thirtie fiue yeare. He was a most noble Prince, &amp; of most singuler pietie: he neuer forsooke him duringe al his sicknes, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming diligentlie this last office of charitie, and exhorting him to dy well, as he had allways stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him vp to good life before. I doubt not but that he had a particuler obligation to serue him, in a busines of so great importance, where he was to be in danger of gayninge, or loosinge heauen. For it is true that he was the more moued by a fatherlie charitie, and therfore hauing purposed to go to Rome to the generall chapter (he being at this time Prouinciall of the Prouince of Paris) he was stayed by the Kinge, and by his brother the Cardinall Ioyeuse, Protectour of their order, who would haue him deferre his voyage, for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this last dutie, which he did with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible fatherlie affection, as he had done to manie others. Notwithstanding att this verie time, he preached in manie of the principall churches of Paris, as he was inuited by vertuous persons, who knewe the fruit which was rendred an hundred fold by the seed of his doctrine.</p>
                     <p>As he passed ordinarilie by villages, he caused the people to be assembled together, he catechised them, and made exhortations to them short, or long, as his leysure permitted him, saying often to his companion, that he tooke great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this. For he was of opinion that it was a verye fruitfull worke, to instruct poore soules, which offend more out of ignorance, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176965:108"/> And he sayd, that he had more deuotion to this, then to preach in the best pulpitt of great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, because there were neuer wantinge many good preachers (thankes be to God) and here they had scarce one in a whole yeare.</p>
                     <p>That it may further appeere by his discourse, how he burnt with charitie. He sayd once: What thing can be more sweete then brotherly chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? which if it were in the world, this should not be a world, but heauen it selfe, we should not be longer men, but Angels, yea we should be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins. <q rend="inline">Imagine I pray you, a citie wherin the lawe of loue and charitie is perfittly obserued. Where children do in all thinges obay their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and parents take great care of their childrē, where man, and wife keepe inuiolatelie their troth plighted one to the other, where bretheren liue in peace, where Princes, and superiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in charitie, and subiects obey in humilitie, where there is not one person found, which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth anie hate, or ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

When one should be sicke, all would run to serue him, when one is poore, all would succour, and relieue him, when he is sad and heauie all would comfort him, where there were noe word of anger, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiō, of il speech, where there were no theft, or detractiō, where there were no disdaine, enmitie, contentions, or discorde, but a perfitt peace and concorde, what would you say of such a citie, if here were anie such in the world? would you not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176965:109"/> esteeme it most happy? would you not call it a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise on earth? would not euerie one seeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire thether, and to dwell therein? Such was the companie of Christians in the Primitiue Church, when all their goods were in common, when they sould their professions, and laid the prise of them at the Apostles feete. And for as much as by humane frailtie, this holy citie of loue, and peace failed to the body of the Church, for repairing of it, religious men haue entered, to maintaine, and conserue the image of this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, where all had not but one hart, and one soule, and loued one another hartily: So that (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren) we ought to consider well our obligation, let vs while we call one another bretheren, haue the one and the same Father Iesus Christ, and our Father S. Francis, lett vs haue the one, &amp; the same mother, the Church and religion, hauinge all the same rule. Charitie hath brought vs to this, and charitie mainteyneth vs in this state: charitie doth bind vs with an indissoluble band, which being taken away all good is lost, and the foundation of our religion cannot stand. This is the fire, which must continually burne vpon the altar of our hearts. <hi>Ignis semper ardebit in altari meo.</hi> This is the burninge gold, which must make vs rich. <hi>Suadeo tibi emere aurum ignitum.</hi> Embrace this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie aboue all thinges. <hi>Ante omnia mutuam in vobis metipsis charitatem continuam habentes.</hi> Note this, <hi>ante omnia,</hi> that is, before all thinges. If we must suffer dommage in any other thinge, it should not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:176965:109"/> be in charitie. If any other vertue be lost let not charitie be lost, for this being lost, all is lost. If we correct, if we reproue, if we chastice, if we giue any pennance, let it be in charity. Loue, and do what thou wilt, sayth S. Augustine. All woundes in the body are dangerous, but a wound in the heart is mortall, because it is in the heart which is the beginninge of life; Soe euery mayme, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of vertue is euill, but the want, and defect of this vertue of charitie, is most pernicious, for as much as the foundation of spirituall life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in it.</q>

                     <head>Of his Prudence. THE SEVENTEENTH CHAP.</head>
                     <p>THis vertue beinge the rule, and measure of al that which other vertues do shewe foorth, made this blessed Father admirable in all his life, and in all his conuersation. In his tender age he shewed himselfe to be old in iudgement, in the court his counsells were allways held most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and in religion, his counsels were esteemed oracles. In both estates, he comported himselfe with that discretion, that those that were most apt to censure others, could neuer take hold of him. He was in no sort enuied, and maligned of others, noe not in the Court, where this venime is so cōmon that there are fewe that can escape it. There are many who liue in the world who are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:176965:110"/> very charitable, and will not charge their cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience with the least scruple of that which is euil, but very fewe of these are so prudent, that they can discreetly, and happily direct others, set them in those good wayes, which they themselues treade, and this is belonging to prudence, which is most necessarie after charity. For this is it which instructeth others, what is to be done, what waye is to be taken, when also we are to take our time to do it, and what is to be auoided in vertuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is it which teacheth vs to haue the same countenance, and the same affection, both in prosperity and in aduersity, as the hand is the same, whether the fingers be open or they be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed together. This is it which cōcurreth stil with truth, not with amitie, which for-seeing thinges to come, disposeth soe of things present, that being past, they leaue not behinde them the stinge of repentance. Briefly this is it which this blessed Father possessed in that eminent degree, that if he made no great benefitt for his owne particuler, yet was he made hereby a man most seruiceable for the profitt, and aduantage of others.</p>
                     <p>We haue allreadie obserued manye of his wise actions, and singularly in that particuler peace, accompanied with a generall, which he effected for the good of his countrey, when he went forth of his religion. After his returne to his religion, his brethren admiring his great prudēce, imposed all kind of charges vpon him: he was Guardien in their principall conuents, and two
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:176965:110"/> yeares after he resumed the habitt, he was made Gardien of this conuent of Paris, and afterward Definitour, after that Prouinciall, and then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Definitour. In all which he caryed himselfe so prudentlie, that if he had liued till the Generall chapter followinge, he might haue merited the charge of the Generall of the whole order.</p>
                     <p>This prudent managinge of affaires, was not only for the good of his owne order, but for the benefitt of other religious men, beinge most dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous to aduise others for the way of perfection, and often shewinge them ways to ridd themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues out of great difficulties, whence they thought it impossible to rise out. Hereupon many did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten visit him, and approuing his reasons, they made vse of his counsell in their busines of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test importance.</p>
                     <p>The fame of his prudence was such, that it came to the eares of the Popes holines, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward seing more with his owne eies whilest he was at Rome at the generall Chapter in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care he had of the publicke good, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to haue made him, an associate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation deputed to consult concerninge reguler affaires, and to prouide for the necessities, and maintaininge of religious, esteeming him a man singularly well conuersant in such causes. But he was diuerted from this purpose by Monseigneur Cardinall de Guiry and by other noble persons of Fraunce, who informed him that the Kinge of France would not take well his absence from his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:176965:111"/> kingdome, and besides he was not likely to accept of any such honorable charge, hauinge giuen the defie to all worldly honors, vnles his holines did laie vpon him an absolute commandement.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1608. Duringe the interdict of the common wealth of Venice, many orders forsooke the citie to auoid the violence of the time. This B. Father beinge aduertised that those of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also were gone foort, hhe tooke his iourney to passe by Venice, where he was entertained with great respect of the Duke, with whom he treated these affaires for some fewe daies so prudently, that he made a reconciliation for his order, and brought them into the Dukes good grace, not without admiration of the whole cōmon wealth, and particularly the Duke, who blessed God that he had sent his Angell of peace, to reestablish the affection of the Senat towards that order.</p>
                     <p>One of the perfections in which he did most excell, was the power to reunite those that were deuided, and fallen out by occasion of any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; Insomuch that many noble persons made him in such cases their vmpire, to compose their differences, hauinge an extraordinary great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his prudence, ioyned with great charity.</p>
                     <p>Some of his bretheren asked him one time; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whence commeth it to passe, that so many labour to attaine to perfection, and so fewe arriue to it? we see daily so many deuout people commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat often, to pray much, and exercise much mortification, and yet after many yeares so spent,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:176965:111"/> are little, or nothinge the better, at the least they shewe their imperfections vpon the least occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. The reason is (saith he) that they be not prudent, in the rearing of this spirituall building; For they trustinge to much to their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they despise all sort of counsell, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with the roofe, insteed of laying well, a sure foundation, and would open an entrance for vertues, before they haue made a place for them in their soules.</p>
                     <p>This answer is short, but substantiall, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of due consideration. To make it more cleer I wil relate heere, what he spake once concerning the same subiect. <q rend="inline">To come to perfection as farr as we can attaine, he sayd that Christian prudence did teach vs, that we must obserue three thinges in their due and right order. The first is to purge, and cleanse our selues from sinne. The second is to despise, and to tread vnder our feete all earthly thinges. The third is by the meanes of vertue to aspire to heauenly things; Which three thinges were expressed by the holy Ghost in the twelft of the Reuelation, when S. Iohn saw a great signe in heauen, to witt a woman clothed with the sunne, hauing the moone vnder her feete, and on her head a Crowne of 12. starrs. We may say that this woman doth represent the B. Virgin, or is the Church: but att this time I may say this woman, is the image of a iust soule, and especially of a good religious, which ought first to be clad with the sunne, that is with Iesus Christ, by his grace, &amp;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:176965:112"/> to shine within, and without by charity, and good example. To followe Iesus Christ, to be humble, patient, meeke, as he was: this is to be clothed with the Sun, euen as he which putteth on the roabe of a Kinge, seemeth outwardly to be a king. The second thinge which this woman had was the moone, vnder her feete, by the moone which is variable, and defectuous, and neuer continueth in the same state, all worldly things are implied, as honor, pleasure, riches, vanities, which a good Christiā, especially a good religious ought to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise, and esteeme them as vile, and fading as they are, but she had on her head starrs, which are the third thing. All heauenly things are these starres, vertue, spirituall exercises, loue of eternall things, conuersation with Saints, and in heauen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiō of future felicitie. We must haue these starrs on our heade: that is to say in our thoughts, and in the supreame part of our soule, to thinke often of them, to meditate them, and thirst after the possession of them, to aspire allwayes thither, soe that we may say as farre as it is possible. <hi>Our conuersation is in heauen,</hi> we should beare them in our heade, or vpō our heade in signe of reuerence. And indeed to beare thē on our heade is nothing els, but to seeke the kingdom of God, and his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice before all things: but alas how is this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der chaunged att this day? We haue not the starres vpon our heades, and the moone vnder our feete, but contrariwise the moone on our heades, and the starres vnder our feete; We do not seeke first
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:176965:112"/> the kingdome of God, &amp; his iustice, but we serch after in the first place earthlie things, and vanities, we desire to satisfie our appetites, to haue great estates, and reuenewes, and afterward for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to go to masse, and to a Sermon, to confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp; communion. So that by a foule abuse, that which ought to be the principal, becommeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie successorie, and that which should be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory is made the principall, and we vse that which we should enioye, and enioye that which we should but only vse. And note that S. Iohn did not only see starres on her heade, but a Crowne made of most goodly starres. What doth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to vs, but that he which should haue bene a good Christian, a good religious person, and should haue clothed himselfe with Iesus Christ by imitation, who should haue contemned earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things signified by the moone, and should haue caried heauenly things as starres vpon his heade, by desire, and contemplation, he shall in the next life receaue a Crowne of twelue most bright star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which are meant the ioyes common to all twelue singuler giftes. Foure of the soule; vision, possession, fruition and contemplation. Foure of the body. Charitie, or glorious brightnes, impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie, agilitie, and subtilitie. Foure of the whole man composed of bodie, and soule, the companie of Saintes, the habitation of the Empyrean hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, a generall, and perfitt satietie, and lastly a perpetuall securitie, wherupon he may boldly say with confidence, that which the Apostle S. Paul
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:176965:113"/> saith. I haue fought a good fight (against the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and tentations of the world, and the flesh) I haue finished my course in the practise of vertue, I haue kept the faith (which I promised in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: what remaineth, and resteth nowe, but a Crowne of glory, which shall be giuen to me by God, who ordayninge the lawe of good workes, hath alwaies ordained the reward, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to them.</q>

                     <p>ALthough this B. Father was in the whole course of his life, a patterne of Sanctitie bending all his spirits to the practise of vertues, yet was he obserued at no time to be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more feruent, more charitable, more frind of pouertie, more mortified, more exact in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the Euangelical counsells, then when he was Definitour, Prouinciall, or bore any great charge in the order. The title which lifted him vp outwardly aboue others, did inwardly cast him downe by the centre of abiection, &amp; his thoughts were as farre from the desire of preeminencie, and prelacie, as the earth is remote from the heauens. He liued as well, or better content vnder obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as he did in place of authoritie, by reason
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:176965:113"/> of the difficulties which accompanie those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of charge. He was accustomed to say that a Prelate, or Superiour in the holy Scripture, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Pastour, a Father, and a Phisitian, which qualities he had in an eminent degree.</p>
                     <p>As a pastour he had care of his flocke, not only of the vniuersall good of the Prouince, but of euery one of the bretheren in particuler, he wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched often when others tooke some repose, to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

As a Father he loued all alike, void of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler affection, and alwaies did more then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded others to do, to take away all occasion of excuse from them. As a Phisitian he had a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler care, both of corporall, and spirituall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: he comforted the afflicted, encouraged the weake, and fainte hearted, gaue remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst tentations, hauinge learned much in this kind, by his owne experience. In fine, he was so laborious, and carefull in putting in execution all good offices, that certainely there could be no other recompence sufficient for his trauaile, but the crowne of glory, which he now weareth.</p>
                     <p>When he made his visite, he came to no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, where (if leisure, &amp; opportunitie serued) he made lesse then three, or foure exhortations in the Refectory to all the religious, with so great Zeale endeuoringe to raise them to the highest steppe of

These visits were ful of learninge, and powerfull, as he was of great power in workes, of good example, and wordes of wholesome doctrine. His words did prouoke to deuotion, but his actions did carry men forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and both ioyned together, were as chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which suerly, and strongly did drawe men to lye downe at the feete of the Crucifix, his actions needed not an after excuse, and his wordes required noe replie. He who knewe soe well to obey, knewe also how to command, proposinge to his bretheren the merit, and prize of obedience by the example of Abraham, who for hauinge obeyed God commandinge him to offer vpp his sonne Isaacke, God gaue him the greatest recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which can be imagined, to witt Iesus Christ his only Son begotten of his propre sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so that in the beginninge of the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, it was written, Iesus Christ the Son of Dauid, the Son of Abraham; and after a longe recite of all the circumstances of this action, he sayd.</p>
                     <p>O my most deare bretheren see the great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt of obedience, howe God requited a true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient man.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:176965:114"/> for his Son. O gift exceeding all giftes, o high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and vnspeakeable recompence. What can be sayd more of the meritt of obedience? If this be not sufficient to enamour thee with it, what can be sufficient? But it may be euery obedient person doth not receaue the like fauour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. Heare our Sauiour. Whosoeuer shal do the will of my Father which is in heauen, he shalbe my brother, what more, he shalbe my mother, my Father, and I wilbe his Son.</p>
                     <p>Among his notes of obedience, I lighted vpon certaine generall propositions which he gaue for al sortes of religion, to take away scruples arising, and to make the yoke light, and easy, though in appearance, it seemeth rigorous.</p>

On the contrary side, a disobedient man, is exposed to all tentations, and deceites of the Deuill, and is not gouerned by God, and in this state at the houre of death, findeth the gates of hell open to receaue him, and Lucifer the grand Captaine of disobedient rebells, prepared to torment him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in hell.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet no man (said this B. Father) is obliged to obey his Superiour in acts which are purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whether they be of the vnderstanding, or of the will. As if the Superiour did cōmand him to beleeue a certaine opinion, the inferiour is not
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176965:115"/> bound to obey him for as much as such acts are inward in the soule, which doth immediatly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt it selfe to God alone. For it belongeth to God alone to command such actions, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are depriued of any such right vnlesse these inward actions, be mixed, and confounded with externall actions, for then by vertue of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall action, the inward may be commanded.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We are neuer to obey the inferiour against the commaundement of the Superiour, as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car against the commandement of the Gardien: or the Gardien against the commandement of the Prouinciall, nor the Prouinciall against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Generall, nor the Generall against the Popes commandement, nor the Pope, or any whosoeuer against Gods commandement. Therfore he said.</p>
                     <p>The matter of obedience, is like a clocke well ordered, the master of the clocke maketh the wheeles, and setteth their mouings in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that according to the Sunne, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heauens, there is one little wheele with a hand which sheweth, and pointeth out the houres, there is another greater, which moueth that in the middle, and finally there is on great wheele, which moueth them all, and is as it were the master wheele. Therfor if the smallest wheele will turne swifter, or slower then it is moued of the middle wheele, or the middle wheele, faster then it is stirred of the greater, there would be disorder in the clock, and the hand should not be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:176965:116"/> bound to suffer it selfe to be moued, for it ought to point out the houres, according to the motion of the sunne, and to the intention of the master workman of this frame. In like manner all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a clock well framed, where there are many wheeles which tourne. The Gardien, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall, the Generall, the Pope, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The hand which sheweth these motions is the subiect. To the end then, that it may rightly point, and there be no disorder, the subiect ought to obey in that order as is formerly expressed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A religious man is not boūd to obey his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour against his rule, nor aboue his rule, but only in things that are according to his rule which he hath promised. To obey according to the rule is not vnderstood, only of things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in it, but of all such things, without which those in the rule cannot be obserued, or which do serue for a more perfect obseruance, as reguler scilence, discipline &amp;c. In this case the subiect is obliged to practise obedience.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As often as there is any contempt in anie thing whatsoeuer the Superiour commandeth, though it be aboue the rule, and obedience, it is a mortall sinne. This is vnderstood only of actuall contempt, when through malice, or any euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention this commandement is not fulfilled but is abused, scorned, and mocked, and besides this may be by vertuall, and habituall contempt when as nothing is done against the commandement of the Superiour by malice of heart, or contēptuous

                     <p>Among many other perfections, he had this particuler grace, to discerne spiritts, and to knowe the inclinations of those who frequented him. How he had this, either of his long experience, and obseruations, or by any particuler reuelation I cannot expresse. But this was certaine, that he seeldome looked on any mans face twise, that he would not knowe, or guesse very neare how he was disposed. This was noted singularly, that among all the Nouices he receaued, or caused to be admitted while he was Prouinciall, or Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour there were very few, or none which went not on manfully and religiously in their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He shewed himselfe very familiar to weake, and feble spiritts. He animated the stronger, and more able to trauaile: to the lukewarme, &amp; weake hearted, he wittnessed in outward appearance much rigour, against that which was in his heart, hidinge his loue, and charitie, which held the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and inwardly commanded in his soule.

                     <p>It was obserued that this B. Father in the most importāt affaires, &amp; amōg other matters in electiō of persons to those places wherupon the good of the whole Prouince depēded, &amp; of euery particuler man also, that he might not be transported away by his owne iudgement, he had allwayes recourse to God, with feruent prayer, fastings disciplines, and other austerities to this end, and called for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the holy Ghost, by other holy sacrifices that he might knowe the meritts of those, that were most worthie, and so do that which was most fitt for Gods glory and the good of others. He was wont to say commonly, that election is an humane act which apperteyneth only to reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, and not to beastes, because the sensual appetite, by which beastes are moued is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a particuler good, but the will of man to a common, and generall good. Wherfore (sayd he) to make a good election, and choise, it is meete to repayre first to God, and to pray for the grace of his holy spirit, to implore the intercession of our holy Father S. Frauncis, to do some worke of extraordinarie mortification, and afterward to respect not the particuler commoditie of any, but the vniuersall good of the whole Prouince, and not to choose as they shall be most seruinge our turne, and more fauourable towards vs, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those which are most seruiceable, and most fitt to do a publique benefitt to all; And whosoeuer (sayd he) doth otherwise, doth not the act of a man, but of a beast.</p>

                     <p>For example of this he vsed the ordinary glosse vpon the first chapter of the first booke of the Machabees, which saith that Alexander, when he was neere his end, being asked whom he would leaue his successour in his kingdome after his death, answered the most worthie, and yet he had a son named Nicholas, a brother named Atrides, and he left also his wife great with child: this was an act to the confusion of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who are led by partialitie, and affection in such case. He was not also vnmindful how Pharoa before he chose a man for Superiour ouer all Egipt he made serch for one that was full of Gods spirit. Moyses the guide of the people of the Hebrues a little before his death, beinge to leaue a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ouer al his multitude would not make choise of any of his owne children, or of those of his brother Aaron, but remittinge all to God, he praied for Gods holy inspiration to be directed in this, and he heard these wordes out of the mouth of God. Take Iosua the son of Nun, a man which hath the spirit of God, and lay thy hand vpon him.

                     <p>Among the qualities which a Prelate, or a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ought to haue, this B. Father recited foure, which he gathered out of holy Scripture, as soe many articles of the will of God. The first is, Goodnes of life, and therfore they are called <hi>the salt of the earth.</hi> The second is, the sufficiencie of learninge, because they are called <hi>the light</hi> of the world. The third is force in aduersitie, &amp; therfore they are compared to a <hi>City built vpon a</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. The fourth is, light of good example, for our Sauiour saith that no man <hi>lighteth a candle for to keepe it hid,</hi> but that it being sett vpon a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke may lighten all those that enter into the house. The reason of all this is, because (saith he) man falleth into sinne by foure great euills, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, ignorance, infirmitie, and malice, which were as the foure great woundes which Prelats who are the Phisitians of the soule ought to remedy, and cure with proper Antidotes, which cannot be better ministred then by these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For concupiscence of our vnruly appetites, the salt of good life is very proper. For ignorance
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:176965:119"/> of the vnderstandinge, the light of learninge, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the infirmitie of free will, the citie was built vpon a mountaine, and the lampe of good example, serueth to driue away the malice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse will.</p>
                     <p>How this B. Father was indued with all these qualities, it is sufficiently proued by the former Chapters; For he had eminently these two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of salt, which are to keepe meats from corruption, and to season the vnsauory; whose only sight often restrayned others from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinnes, and made others sauourably tast of those mortifications which are in themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vnpleasinge, by becomminge to them as salt to season them. For by his example he encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged others: and often compared a Prelate, whose wordes are not accompanied with deedes to a salt seller without salt, or to euented, and corrupted salt which is faire in shewe, and in effect serueth not for that vse, for which it should be seruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Besides good life, knowledge is required to conduct others: He sayd that for this conduct there were two Keyes to be had, one of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, an other of Knowledge, and the one and the other ought to accompanie good life. Whence it commeth that God, sayd he, would giue the Keys of the house of Dauid vpon the shoulder of Eliacim, not about his neck, nor att his gridle, nor in his hand. Those, weare the keys on their neck, which search prelacies to be honored and respected. Those beare them
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:176965:119"/> in their handes which seeke to content their frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des as anie occasion is offerred, not respectinge others though more fitt, and sufficient. And those weare the Key att their girdles, who who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie seeke their owne priuate commodity; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, make good cheare, and liue in al pleasure &amp; ioylitie. He added for better explication, how this light ought to be accōpanied with goodnes: that there are two sortes of goodnes, the one absolute, the other respectiue. The absolute consisteth in the loue of God, as the foundation of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall light, and knowledge, without which a Prelate, or Superiour is as a shipp vpon the sea without an helme, caryed with the windes of his passion, and the stretched out sayles of the vanitie of his desire: but this is not enough to haue this absolute goodnes, we must haue also respectiue, to witt knowledge, discourse, discretion, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prudence, for as much as this goodnes is a certaine rule and direction to finde meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and well suting to euery mans end. Absolute goodnes is the end, but respectiue is that which giueth the meanes to attaine to it. For how (sayth he) can a Superiour gouerne well which hath neither discourse nor iudgement, nor practise to knowe, &amp; discerne how he must guide this or that person? Because he must carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe otherwise to the good, then to the badd, in one sort to him that is strong and lustie, and in an other sort to him, that is weake, and feeble: he must rule the one with sharpnes, and seueritie, the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:176965:120"/> other with sweetnes. A Superiour must shewe himselfe sometimes rigorus, and sharpe, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sweet, and affable, sometimes he must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, and expect, other times take them vpon the present occasion. Briefely he ought to haue respectiue goodnes, &amp; soe much the more he shall haue, by soe much he shal be more fitt to gouerne. And for this cause in elections, he is to be chosen which hath absolute, and respectiue both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet he that hath more respectiue, is to be preferred before him which hath lesse.</p>
                     <p>The third qualitie wherewith our Sauiour would haue a Prelate indued is force, and constā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of spiritt. Lett him not be as an emptie reed light, vaine, and inconstant, let not him suffer him selfe to be caryed away with the wind of his passions, loue, hatred, hope, feare, reuenge, but without apprehension, lett him sustaine the right, and Iustice, yea although it be with perill of his life, and speake freely the truth where and when it is needfull, whether it please, or do not please: lett him haue nothing before his eies, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God principally, and the good of his Church, or religion, lett him not be an accepter of persons, but equall to all, lett him haue no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to Prelacie, lett him not seeke it, neither lett him be moued to do any vnfitt or vndecent thing for it. <hi>Such a one</hi> (sayd this B. Father) is a citie, not scituated in a valey of feare, of hope, or of his owne proper passion, but vpon a mountaine of a free hart, lifted vp aboue all earthly thinges,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176965:120"/> and only attentiue to the will of God. A citie of refuge for the poore oppressed &amp; afflicted, which receaueth all, and giueth reliefe to all according to their necessitie: Such a citie as S. Iohn descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in the Apocalipse 21. which hath the walls of gold, the gates of pearle, and in the midst of it is the tree of life, which bringeth foorth fruite, whose leaues are also medicinable, such a one ought a Prelate to be, embellished with gold, and pearles, that is to say with vertue, and merits, the tree of life ought to be in his heart, the leaues which are medicinall, are his wordes of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; the abundant fruites his good workes. In the end the fourth qualitie of a Prelate or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, is that he be a lampe shininge vpon a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke, that is to say, that he teach others more by example, then by word: Wherfore our Sauiour did not content himselfe to say, that they should be the light of the world, which properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth to the sunne, for as much as the sunne shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge in the world, doth it in his motion without paine, or feeling any incommodity, but the lampe giueth light to its owne cost, because it consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it selfe. Soe Iesus Christ who is the rule, and square of others, hath not illuminated the world only as the sunne, but as a lampe put vpon the candlesticke of the house, whereto lighten vs he consumed himselfe in leesinge his owne life. This is so worthie of serious consideration, that this blessed Father could not thinke of it without breakinge into these wordes. O how many are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:176965:121"/> those now which seeke after dignities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy to shine in high place, and as the Sun to giue light without their paine, and trauaile, and not as the lampe. Do ye beleeue and knowe who these are? they are those of whom Saint Mathewe speaketh in the 23. Chapter. <hi>Qui allegant onera grauiae, &amp; importabilia, digito autem suo nolunt ea mouere.</hi> Who tye great and most heauy burdens vpon others, but they will not touch them with a finger. These are they who in Prelacie regard honors, and not the paines, which seeke after dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to liue att their ease, to be honored, res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to receaue all kind of contentment, in fine they be sun, not lampe. We read in holy Scripture two sorts of Cherubins, the first were made of Moyses by Gods commandement; they looked towards the propitiatory, and had their faces tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one against the other. The second were made by Salomon, and put in the temple, but they did looke towardes the propitiatory as the first, nether did they looke one vpon the other, but had their faces turned towards the outward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; What should this signifie, but two sorts of Prelates where of the first made, and chosen of God, are good, holy, wise, zealous, and regard only the propitiatory, that is to say the glory of God, without turninge their eies, but vpon the knowledge of themselues; for they are lampes which giue light to the house to their owne Cost. The others which are elected but not of God, but by the grace, and fauour of men, by suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:176965:121"/> and homages, and these do not looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the propitiatory, or the honour of God, but the outward temple, their owne Interest, their owne preferment, or contentment, true sunnes which increase in their splēdour, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trauaile or paine. Let Prelates and Superiours (my bretheren) which ought to be chosen propose to themselues an other end, lett them be salt to their good life, light for their doctrine, a citie for the force and strenghte, a lampe for good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so shal they haue all conditions necessarily required.</p>

                     <p>THe number is great of those that beginne well, but very small of those that end well: but this blessed Father hauinge these wordes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his mout, hand truly grauen in his heart. <hi>Quicunque perseuerat vsque ad finem, saluus erit,</hi> went forward in his good designes couragiously, and perseuered till the end, neither did he rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to continue in that estate wherunto God had exalted him, but he lett no occasion nor, no houre passe in which he did not striue still to go forward, and aduance himselfe in vertue and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so that euery day wrought some change in him, with euident markes of more perfection, for he was wont to say that as soone as a mā giues
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176965:122"/> ouer the care and diligence of betteringe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe daily, and profitinge in pietie, and deuotion, he presently ceased to be good, and so he estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med perseuerance the mother of perfection. S. Paul (said he) had but a badd beginninge, but his end was good, holy, and glorious. S.

Those that end well, though they began ill, are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in holy Scripture, the other condemned. The vertue of euery good worke, consisteth in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance: the life of a religious, and iust man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the Canticles, to the morninge, and in the Prouerbs to light, which goeth on encreasing till perfitt day. <hi>Iustorum semita quasi lux splendens, crescit vsque ad persectum diem.</hi> Soe a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and religious person ought to encrease, and goe forward in the seruice of God, as a faire morninge, and cleare light, which groweth on euen to the perfitt brightnes of the day of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, where it cannot be more perfitt, hauinge at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the vttmost terme of perfection.

                     <p>The practise of this holy vertue did not only appeere in this B.

For if there were a matter which concerned the conuersion of a sinner, or the consolation of some eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for the losse of some thing wherin he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great contentment, he feared not great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the beginninge (knowing that all sortes of spiritts, are not easily moued by reasonable perswasions) but in the end he obteyned his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, redoublinge the violence of his holie perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

And when as some told him that it was almost impossible to cure such an old soare, and an euill so farre growen by long custome. To thē he answered. I wil do that at least which Gods holy spirit shall inspire me, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176965:123"/> which I am bound to speake. God I hope of his grace will giue force, and effect to my wordes, &amp; accomplish the rest, if it be his holy will. He did so, and was so vehement against these exercises, that the zeale of his soule appeared in his face, &amp; he obteyned much more then men could imagine; bringinge to passe that those dayes were spent in exercises of deuotion, and piety, which before were past in debauches, and sinfull vanities. He went often to visit prisoners, and made publique exhortations to them, besides particuler confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with euery one a part, of which labour he gather<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d a great fruite. For some which had noe feelinge of deuotion, and would not heare of Confession, nor the Sacraments, were moued to confesse and communicate most deuou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly, and did with great patience expect their sentence, whereas before they did nothinge but blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. He began before Lent these holy visitts, and duringe that time, cōtinued it thrise a weeke with an earnest affection, althoughe he preached, and fasted euery day, soe that oftentimes, he had no leysure to take his poore dinner, because he would haue more time to comfort, and assist the poore soules.</p>
                     <p>The reader will excuse me, if I preuent here an obiection which may be made against his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance because he went out of his Monastery sometime: but because the publique benefitt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his departure, he merited as much in that time, as if he had continued in religion, besides
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176965:123"/> he practised all deuotions, that he could well vse, when occasion was offered. And God which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth the wills of men, when they cannot shewe the effects, gaue noe doubt the same grace to his good affections, as he had don to the very workes. And that we may see what greife he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued hereby, that he could not perseuere in this course of life, I will report his owne wordes, which he applyed to the religious, who after some time spent in religion should haue any desire to retourne to the thickets of thornes in the world.</p>
                     <p>He compared them to the children of Israel, who where they heard that they must fight to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the land of promise, a land flowinge with milke and honie, they were much dismayd, and weepinge all night, incited one an other to choose a captaine who might lead thē backe into Egipt, forgetting what they had suffered vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall yoke of Pharao: And behold (said he) the reason why men do not perseuere in vertue! which is because they feare labour and paine, and this proceedeth from their want of consideration, and courage, or witt, that they do not see what grat recompence followe short labours, and howe eternall torments succeed their short pleasures. This is it which happeneth spiritually to a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, which is gon well on his way in the desert of Pennance, and hath endured much for Gods seruice, and is affrighted with certaine shadowes, which the Deuill putteth in his fancy
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:176965:124"/> entertayneth some purpose to returne backe to his life past with the body, or with the soule, and sayth. Let vs make vs a Captaine, &amp; returne backe into Egipt.</p>
                     <p>O wretched man, how is it, that thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynest this idle dreame? thou hast allready made a great part of thy iourney, and wilt thou now go back? thou art very neere the land of promise, and haue but a little patience, and thou wilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently arriue there, and there solace thy selfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Thou dost not consider, that thou shalt not enioye the fruites, and fauors of Gods prouidence which thou hadst in religion; and in the state of grace. He fedd thee with heauenly Manna, then shalt haue no other foode but the husks of swine. He opened for thee the red sea, so thou didst passe through it, without wettinge thy feete, thou wilt then finde it closed vp, and thou wilt be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in it. He deliuered thee from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Pharao, and now thou wilt vndergoe a harder yoke of sla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>age. And because thou art not content to suffer a little while, thou wilt suffer for all eternitie; and whilest thou seekest to auoid the burden, and heate of the day, thou wilt suffer the torments of eternal flames: and whilest thou refusest some small trauaile and paine, thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasest thy selfe infinitely fair more, and greater, both in this life and in the life to come: whereas with light and short paine, thou sufferest for the loue of God, thou mightest haue bought eternall ioy, glory, and repose. O vngratefull foole worthy

                        </gap> doest not see it, ô blind and miserable man.</p>
                     <p>He had alwaies before his eies many great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to stirre vp his soule to turne al her thoughts, and affections to this holy vertue of perseuerance, as he hath left some of them written by his owne hand. The first was, the necessitie of it, for it is necessary to the attayninge of that heauenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, which is giuen to vs after our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall labour, and paine. And without this all other things profitt vs nothinge, as it is manifest, by the sentence pronounced out of the mouth of Iesus Christ, the authour of truth, and the very truth in essence.</p>
                     <p>For this cause he compared the entrance into religion with baptisme, by which grace is recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the child of darknes is made the child of light. He said moreouer, that heauen was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them as a portion common with the elect, prouided alwaies said he, that we keepe our good purpose, which we had then, euen to the end, and that we keepe the vowe which we made: to be breife, so that we perseuere to the end, and this is the necessitie of perseuerance.</p>
                     <p>The second thing which he considered in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance was the excellencie of it, wheras it is (as hath bene already spoken) the mother of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for it giueth that contentment vnto vs, after we haue practised some vertue, that we thinke of nothinge more, then of the continuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of it.</p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:176965:125"/>
                     <p>The third thing was, that he knew this vertue to be the gift of God, and therefore he dearely cherished, and respected it. It is said formally, and immediately the gift of God, wherfore we must still pray for it, and instantly demand it of God, for the grace which we haue receaued of God in iustification is not sufficient for a iust man, but he hath need of new supply, and newe grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere, as S. Thomas teacheth. For although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance, as it signifieth a good habitude, and vertuall meanes, by which we haue a full purpose to perseuere to the end, be in the soule of a iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h grace, and other vertues; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge, for as much as it signifieth a certaine continuation euen to the end of life, in this sort it doth not alwayes followe grace, but lett a man be neuer so holy yet standeth he in need of new fresh ayd, and of the speciall grace of God, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this great gift of perseuerance, and herein we ought wholy to mistrust our selues, &amp; to rely wholy vpon Gods goodnes, and mercie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reade that our holy Father S. Francis, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had receaued the holy signes, and markes, and made so high a degree of sanctitie, so feared himselfe, that he answered one that called him. Sainct, that if God did forsake him he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the sinnes of the world. And if S. Francis after so high fauours of God, feared to become a sinner, what may we feare, beinge so farr short of him in holines of life? Why therfore should not we mistrust our selues, and humbly begg of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:176965:125"/> God, that he would giue vs continuall obedience, and conformitie to this holy will?</p>
                     <p>The fourth motiue was, that he sett before his eiyes continually the first feruours of his Nouice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp, thinking it a great dishonour to him, if it should be said that his beginninge was more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious then his end, whereas accordinge to the common sayinge, not to proceede in the waie of vertue, is to goe backe, and recoyle: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he cited the wordes which S. Paul wrote to the Hebrewes newly cōuerted to the faith. <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moramini pristinos dies in quibus illuminati magnum certamen passionum sustinuistis.</hi> My bretheren remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber often the first day of your Nouiceshipp, in which ye beinge illuminated, did valiantly resist the battery of many passions, and won the victory of them by Gods grace.

The Deuill withall his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, tentations, ambushes, stratagems, feares, and affrights, to with-hold you from your holy purpose, and yet yee triumphed gloriously ouer all these enemies, and lifted vp the standard of the Crosse: att the same time, <hi>venistis, &amp; vidistis, &amp; vicistis,</hi> ye came and beheld them, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them. O happy day, ô memorable bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ô noble victory by meanes whereof, the heauens, God himself, and the Angells reioyced,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:176965:126"/> the earth was astonished, and hell trembled for feare: how many crownes haue bene prepared from that houre for you as conquerers? <hi>Rememo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramini pristinos dies.</hi> Remember I say your first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, when as ye not vnlike to vessells filled with sweet, or new wine, which boyleth, and riseth, not able to containe with you the abundāce of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine consolations, ye were forced to burst foorth with great violence, into groanes, sighes, &amp; teares, and with danger lest the brickle vessells ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with this violent entry of the floodes of the house of God, were nor broken to pieces.</p>
                     <p>He beinge animated with these motiues perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered constantly in the practise of those vertues, which he had begunne to put in vre, and was not dismayed, by any austerity, and difficultie in the prosecutinge of that vertue, wherupon our sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les health dependeth, and the blessed end of our pilgrimage.</p>
                     <p>For tell me (said he) should not we esteeme him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

How much greater is the folly of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or religious person, who hauinge gayned a great treasure of meritts, will plaie it awaie all at once committing one mortall sinne? Therfore to preuent so great mischiefe. <hi>Patientia nobis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria est.</hi> Patience is necessary for you. By patience there is not only vnderstood the sufferance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, but that which is called Longanimitie,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:176965:126"/> which is longe sufferinge, which is indeed perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, and stablenes of spirit in that which is good, which is so necessary for the seruant of God, that without it, all is lost, and he shall neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the promise, which God hath made to him of the possession of the kingdome of heauen. <hi>Vt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem Dei facientes reportetis promissionem.</hi> That doinge the will of God ye may carrie awaie his promise. This is an abridgement of some of his vertues. The greatest part was only knowen to God; And for his actions most remarqueable, the Capucins (as they are farre from all ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hidinge themselues from the eies of the world) haue neglected to make any exact colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Wherin (be it spoken without offence) I thinke they haue done amisse, for his Heroicall vertues, had not only serued for a perpetuall mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or glasse of millions of soules, to drawe them out of the sea of the world, and to bringe them to the sanctuary of religion: but it had doutlesly swaied much with many obstinate persōs in their sinfull life, &amp; had forced them to admire his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wherby many would haue changed their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and become better. For there is nothinge that doth preuaile more in this kind, then the example of such eminent persons as he was; and moreouer it is Gods holy wil, that his frindes be praised, and commended for their actions, if not duringe their liues, because the corruption of this age would call it flattery, yet after their death, where vanitie cannot seaze vpon the soule, and when as the end hath crowned the worke.</p>

They had the Sea &amp; wind gainst them all along their voyage, and were shrewedly beaten with tempestuous weather, which ceased by meanes of his prayers, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great wonderment, and reioysinge of other passengers, which being driuen by the windes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rockes, could expect nothinge but a disastrous shippwracke. These incommodities of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:176965:127"/> the sea, made his companion fall into a feuer, when he was arriued at Ciuita Vectia. Wherupon the B: Father Angell was constrayned to sett him on horsebacke going after him the rest of the way. This good religious man was much greiued at it, beinge ashamed to ride himselfe on horsebacke, &amp; his Prouincial a foote. He demanded pardon of him withal submission: &amp; Father Angel did seeke to comfort him as much as he could, sayinge that God permitted this for a greater good, and that he did drawe sweetnes out of bitternes, as water out of the rocke, that at their returne they should haue more leysure to repose themselues, that they should resigne themselues to Gods holy will, and with spirituall discourse, he sweetned the rigor of the rest of the way, till they came to Rome. When he was came to Rome, the first thing, that he did after he had confessed, and visited the holy places, was to humbly present himselfe to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, who seeinge him prostrate on the ground to kisse his feete, he lifted him vpp, and gaue him his hand to kisse, shewinge extraordinary affection to him, and reioysinge much to see him, which he witnessed by the effects. For whiles he seiourned att Rome, he sent him euery day some confiture, and such presents, which might not be vnfitt for a poore Capucin to receaue, knowing well, that his body hauing bene delicately bred, and fedd in his youth, needed some kind of restauratiues after the trauaile of so long a iourney.

                     <p>This generall Chapter is an assembly of the Prouincialls, of the whole order in what part of the world soeuer they are, with two Gardiens of euery Prouince, where there are such perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

Notwithstandinge he ceased not somtimes to visitt his holines, who gaue him freely, and with great contentment audience as often as he came. All Rome was filled with the sweete o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of his vertues, if he passed by the streetes, euerie man desired to see him, and his naturall grauitie, his comlie tall stature, and his port full of maiestie, appearinge vnder the modestie of his poore habitt, did shewe what he had ben, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intimation of those that knewe him. If he entred into Churches, all admired his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Conuent all the Fathers, desired one after another, to haue conference with him, to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:176965:128"/> learne somewhat of him. The sick persons which lay vpon their strawe beds, receiued great conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by his visits. To be short, hauinge no other time for him selfe, but for to say Masse, he was fayne to take the night time for the dispatch of his publique busines, and other particuler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions which he had, yet was he as chearefull the next morninge, as it he had sweetely rested, &amp; fell to the same taske againe.</p>
                     <p>His companion wondered att this, and taking brotherly libertie which he had giuen to him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished him thus, and sayd, that this great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall labour would ouerthrowe his health, if he were not more prouident in giuinge him selfe some rest. To whom he answered, that God was to good, as not to haue care of his seruants, and that it was for him to dispose of them as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, and for them to put in practise what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them: and this was a thing very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queable, that in the thick cloudes of so many bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, he had allwayes a smilinge, and serene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in token of his inward ioye.</p>
                     <p>He was wont to say, that God loued nothinge, which doth not proceed from a ioyfull hart, and contentment of affection, and all those that beare the crosse, do not receaue the fruites, and benefitts of it. For (sayd he) I find, explicating the wordes of S. Paul. God forbidd that I should glorie in any thing, then in the Crosse of Christ. I finde herein (sayd he) three sorts of persons, some that salute, and adore the Crosse, but do not beare it,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:176965:129"/> nor glory themselues in it, such are those which can well discourse of it and praise it much, but when occasion is presented, they fly, and abandō it. There ar some others which beare it, but they glorie not in it, and these are they who suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, tribulations, or infirmities, because they can do no otherwise, herein like to Simon Sire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus which assisted our Sauiour in bearinge his crosse, but not of good will, but by constraint.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly there are others, who do not only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and beare the Crosse, but they glory therin, bearinge willinglie their necessities, and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reioysinge in Gods holy will, and thanke God who hath vouchsafed to make them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Chalice. The last of these three sorts do only gather the sauourous fruits of the Crosse, and find glory in infirmitie, life in death, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in bitternes, ioy in sorrowe, and an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable treasure in pouertie. Whence it cōmeth to passe many deceaue thēselues, thinkinge that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection consisteth in enioyinge their ease with gust and feelinge, in visions, extasies, and rapts, in great speculations of the vnderstandinge, in delightfull sweetnes of the affection. But alas it consisteth in none of these. It is in imitating our Sauiour Iesus Christ vpon the Crosse, where all the Saints haue searched him, and found him, which is to trauaile for the loue of God. This is the marck we ought to ayme at, stirred vp besides by the exāple of Iesus Christ, by that our Seraphicall Father S. Frauncis, which was a new crucified man, and bearinge
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:176965:129"/> these holy markes. <hi>Ego enim stigmata Domini Iesu in corpore meo porto.</hi> The chapter being finished he beinge now to returne to Fraunce, went to take his last farewell of his holines, who gaue him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with wonted, and accustomed fauour, and seeing by his humble thankes, which he gaue for his presentes receaued, that he was ready to depart, he renewed againe great offer of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which he refused with great humility, as he had done formerly. After these refuses of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, he gaue a great Crosse of gold, with two chappelers of Agats, one for his daughter Madame the Dutchesse, and the other for Madamoselle de Monpensier her daughter, and his grandchild, but this could not moue his resolution, for he was not only dead to all things of the world, but they were also dead in him, so that he had neuer accepted them, if his holines, and the B. Father: Generall who was present, had not absolutely commanded him to take them. Hauinge taken them he prostrated himselfe, and tooke his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines blessinge withall humilitie, who counselled him with Fatherly charitie to continue in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious designes, with promise to keepe him in his remembrance, and to witnes his affection to him as occasion should be, ether for his particuler, or the good of his religion in Generall.</p>
                     <p>His holines requested him often to go on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and not to expose his health to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heate of the season, and of the climate, to which he was not accustomed. Which he refused
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:176965:130"/> with great humilitie, beinge not willing to release any thing of the austerity of his order. So being full of zeale, after he had taken his leaue of the Cardinalls and some other eminent persons, he departed from Rome, the tenth of August 1608. leauinge the whole citie replenished, with the odour of his exemplary deuotion and admiration of his prudence.</p>

                     <p>This B. Father departinge from Rome, had many good proiects in his heade, which he could
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:176965:130"/> not finish, because God seeing also that he had noe other obiect but himselfe, did dispose of all otherwise for his glory.</p>
                     <p>As he came downe, the people in all places being aduertised that he was to passe by them, pressed much to see him, who after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the spirituall foode of his exhortations, thought themselues happy if they could kisse his habitt: so God would haue his holines of life te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by his actions to be knowen, and to haue some parcell of that honor, which is now due to him, and which he enioyeth for euer. You might haue seene many principall men of the nobilitie to go foorth to meete him, instantly requestinge him to take vp his lodginge with them. Which he did neuer accept, or very seldome, when he could retire himselfe to any conuent: for although he were neuer so poorely treated, he tooke farr more contentment to be there, then he did where there was rich plentie of all thinges, hauinge long since forsaken rich, and plentifull meanes, to embrace pouertie, with hartie, and true affection.</p>
                     <p>Religious men were as much cheered with his presence, as secular, euery one was edified with the sight of him only, besides the fruit which they gathered, by his discourse, and conference. For as he discoursed often and most effectually of that which swayeth most in our affection, soe he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his spirit bent principally to a rigorous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of his vowes, did speake of this subiect not without admiration, soe that one time (I
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:176965:131"/> know not whether it were in Fraunce, or in Italy) speaking to the religious, and taking a similitude of the Pomegranate (he said) If ye haue obserued, the Pomegranate hath foure things. The first is the outward Rine, or barke which is rough, hard, and bitter. The second is the sweet fruite within. The third is the multitude of red graines, which ar so well ordered, and sett together, that they seeme to be so many rubies. The fourth is that it hath in the topp, a faire crowne. This is an hierogliphick of the state of religious, euery particuler man ought to ressemble this, much more euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and the whole order of religion. They ought to be sharpe in austerities, fastinges, disciplines, shirtts of hard, haire in poore clothing and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their bodies &amp;c. But with this outward sharpenes, and bitternes, there is mixed inward sweetnes, the consolations of the holy spirit, the inward cheeringe, and entertaynement of God which he giueth to a good soule, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his lawe, the hope of future glory, the sweetnes which is felt in doinge good workes, and in the obseruance, of Gods commandements, and his rule, this is the sweet fruit of the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate. The third thing is the multitude of grai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the vnion, the order, the disposition, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. This betokeneth the multitude of good workes, the vnion, the charitie, the peace which ought to be among vs, order in all things, that no man hinder his companion, but that he ayde him, that all with one hart be mercifull, enflamed,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:176965:131"/> and feruent; And when they be so, what remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but the crowne of the Pomegranate, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of eternall glory which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to vs. The consideration wherof ought to make vs thinke all paine, and trauaile, light, and sleight. He confirmed this with infinite examples taken out of scripture, and prophane authors, soe that his wordes were as piercinge shafts, which wounded the hearts of the hearers, or rather as firebrands to kindle the fire of deuine loue in their soules, and to enable them to suffer, and beare the Crosse of their master.</p>
                     <p>As he came neere to Turin, he would not enter into the citie, but said it was best to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to a Conuent of their order called Nostra Dona de la Campana: distant about a league from the towne, which he did the rather to auoid the occasion of visiting the Dukes highnes. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing banished all curiosity from his affection, he declined as much as he could possibly the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge of great persons. But he did attempt this in vaine, for by what accident I knowe not, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods disposition for some good, he mett the Dukes highnes in the way, who after he knewe him, entertained him with all possible cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. He entertained about halfe an houres dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursinge with him about Fraunce, Rome, and some matters of state, and religion. The good Father excused himselfe, as pressed and streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by little time, wherupon, his highnes told him, that he would come to him the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:176965:132"/> as he did, and passed the whole morninge with him in the Conuent.</p>
                     <p>This night the B. Father began to sicken, and had a little fitt of an ague, which brake his repose, yet thinkinge that it was a matter of nothinge, and it was only the wearines of his long iourney, he ceased not the next morninge after he had said masse, to entertaine his highnes againe two or three houres, who offered him all courtesies, that lay in his power, and prayed him to be mindfull of him in his holy sacrifices. Of whom, after he had taken his leaue, he went on his way towardes Riuoly, where there is a Conuent of Capucins. Riuoly is a little towne scituated wel for fertility, two leagues from Turin. This good Father repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing there, purposed to haue gone thence the next morninge after masse, which was the day of the markes of S. Frauncis. But alas he was defeated of his purpose; For as he was att the altar, he was taken with a great shaking, and trembling of his ague, that he could hardly finish masse; soe that assoone as he had ended, he was carried into his chamber, and neuer went of it till he had rendered his soule in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:176965:132"/> Father keepe his bed, but he sent presently his best Phisitians, and his Apothecarie to visitt him, and yeeld him all helpe and comfort they could: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them expresly, to haue a speciall care of him, and to serue him with as much affection, as they would serue himselfe. They signified so much to him, and performed it really, sparing not paine, nor mony, and employing their best ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to alaie the heate of his fieuer, which was so violent, that they could do him little, or noe good.</p>
                     <p>The B: Father iudging by the extremitie of his disease, that he could not continue long, and that he was come to the end of his pillgrimage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed himselfe into the handes of God. But as it is the manner of the most perfect, to mistrust their meritts, esteeminge themselues so much the greater sinners, as they abound more in grace, he said that it if pleased God to haue compassion on him, he would yet liue, hauinge not done the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nāce which his sinnes required. Herein not vnlike to S. Francis who after many yeares of penāce was alwaies but vpon his beginnings; And so turning his thoughts to this end, he began with humble thankes giuinge to God for the care he had of his soule, knowinge that Gods holy hand, layeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and diseases vpon vs, accordinge to our forces, or according to such forces, wherwith he disposeth to fortifie and strengthen vs. For when we consider dolours, and afflictions in their owne
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:176965:133"/> obiect with the eie only of nature, we haue cause to be deiected with sadnes, but since we are not only men, but Christians also, we ought by the power of grace to consider them better, and pearcing through the cloudes, of the accidents of this life, beholde cleerlie Gods holy dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and lift vp our spirits high, and so see the end, which is designed to all, and comfort our selues in the great profitts, and benefitts which are to redound to vs thereby. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation sunck into the hart of this B. Father, soe that in the extremest paines of his disease, he was as thoughe he had ben vnsensible. Blessed (sayd he) are they who suffer anie thinge for heauen, their dolours, and greifes shalbe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with ioy and gladnes; the more we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the more we satisfie for the paynes due to our sins, this is the great mercie of God, which doth punish our sinnes and crimes in this world. For so we depart out of it with expectation of more comfort. Afterward he was visited by manie that were well affected to his order, which insteede of giuinge him comfort, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it from him, in soe much that they who entred to see him full of sorrowe, departed from him with great contentment, wonderinge much of his great constancie. He made them vnderstand how much it importeth to liue wel, if we will dye well, and how hard it is to come to heauen, which is a place of so great puritie.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:176965:133"/> Howe likewise those abuse themselues, who deferre the amendement of their liues to their end, whereas it falleth out, that selldome he dyeth well, who hath liued ill. He did entertaine them with these, and the like discourses. All the religious of the Conuent one after another visited him, whom he instantlie besought to assist him with their sacrifices, and prayers, and to begg of God pardon for his sinnes, and especiallie that he might be holpen by the last Sacrament, when they sawe fitt time, without waytinge the extremitie, wherin was danger of committinge an irrecouerable fault.</p>
                     <p>His Companion was allwayes with him, and entertayned him allwayes in spirituall discourse. He prayed him to recite deuoutly the prayers of the Romane ceremoniall, made to this particuler end for the comfort, and reliefe of sick persons. For amonge other prayers he made great account (as a good Christian ought) of those deuotions which the Church doth vse, and of the ceremonies of his order, which haue a particuler vertue for those ends which they were instituted.</p>
                     <p>He growinge weaker dayly by the violence of his disease, which grewe vpon him, he desired to fortifie himselfe, with the buckler of a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick in this last action. Wherfore after he had confessed with his accustomed deuotion, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that they would bring him the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:176965:134"/> which he knewe, not only to be the strēgth of his soule, and the foode therof, but alsoe an appeasement of his bodily dolours. The Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father Prouinciall yelding to his request, allthough he thought he was not in such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, brought it him after Mattins, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in procession with all the religious of the Conuent. O what eleuation of his soule had he att the sight of his Sauiour vayled vnder the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His Cheekes becomminge vermilion red as the rose, and his teares tricklinge downe his eies witnessed sufficiently, what inward discourse he had with his Sauiour, captiuatinge all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and powers to giue him thankes for so great a benefit. Before he receaued, he would followe this last actiō of S. Frauncis to dy naked, and depriued of all things, sauinge the loue of God. Wherefore he besought Fa. Prouinciall, that he might consigne into his handes, some small presents, which his holines had sent to Madame his daughter. He put allso those memorialls which he had of the affaires of their general Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the hands of his companion, assuring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Fa. Prouincial, that if he did also commit to him the other presents, that he should satisfie the intention of his holines: and as for himselfe, he desired nothinge more then to depriue himselfe of the proprietie of the least things that could be imagined, to possesse God more perfectly. Hauing often in his mouth the wordes of the Apostle. <hi>Mihi viuere Christus est, &amp; mori lucrum.</hi> Vnto me
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:176965:134"/> to liue, is Christ, and to dy is gaine. Moreouer he demanded leaue of the Fa. Prouinciall to renewe his vowes, and to offer them a fresh to God, the which he hauing once consecrated to God, neuer had any mind to change it, allthough the violence of the people tooke him from his Conuent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testinge now that it was against his will, and that whiles he was out, he allways longed after that, which he did enioy att this present. He did al this with extraordinarie deuotion, and hauinge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the wordes very distinctlie, he made a briefe exhortation, but verie feruent to those that assisted him, and shewed to them the contentmēt which his solitude had caused to him: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended much the perfection, and happie state of religion, saying that God doth drawe his frinds to it to feede them with the sweete milke of his grace, not that they should liue as they did before, the life of plants, for that is but earthly, nor the life of sensible creatures, for that is but brutal, nor the life of men onlie, for that is but humane, nor the life of the Angells, for that is but created, but to liue of the verie life of the diuinitie, for he wil make vs liue, and enioy his essence, and his essence is life, and the springe of life: with thee is the fountaine of life sayd Dauid, so he wil make them enter into the life, which he liueth himselfe with the Son, and the holy Ghost in the companie of those, among men, and Angells, whom it hath pleased him to make worthie of so great grace.</p>
                     <p>All his bretheren standinge about him couched
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:176965:135"/> as children about their dying Father, shewinge great signes of heauines, and astonished at his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, seemeing to heare the holy Ghost speake throughe his mouth, and exhort them to their dutie. In conclusion he with his eies full of teares, and a spirit rauished with holy deuotion deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded humbly, pardon of all, both present, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which assoone as he had done, he receaued the holy Sacrament with so much deuotion, that all the assistants felt their hearts touched with a sweet compunction, and an ardent desire to make themselues worthie of so blessed an end.</p>
                     <p>The next morninge his companion seeinge him repose more then ordinarie in great quietnes of body, and spirit (as he thought) most sweetlie, and not knowing the reason of so suddaine a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, thought that it was some beginninge of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tiō, whereupon his better helth did depend. Wherfore he retired into a chamber hard by, and aduertising the religious, that they should not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in to him, least they should breake his repose which seemed to be better, then he had al the time of his sicknes, he was absent for the space of two, or three houres, in which time he tooke a litle rest vpon a strawe bed, hauinge passed some nights before without once closinge his eies. Whiles he tooke this little sleepe, or rather slumber, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be in a great Churchyard, where a quire of Angells, made a most sweete harmonie, he heard them with great attention, admiring at the beautie, and behauiour of these heauenly spirits.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:176965:135"/> Afterward he seemed to come neare a Coffin all be sett with floures, whose odour was meruailous fragrant &amp; sweete, vpon this he wakened sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fearinge leaste the good Father had yelded vp his spiritt (for in such cases dreames do much affright vs) went to his chamber, &amp; openinge soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the chāber doore, he was presently spied by the sick person, who asked him frō whence he came, and how longe he had ben absent, it is about 2. houres since (said he) that I seeing you lye so quiet, I withdrewe my selfe to take some rest. I had thought (sayd the sick Fa:) that it had hardly ben a quarter of an houre, for my soule was neuer in such a calme, being as it were rapt from me, &amp; ful of such ioye, and contentment, that I can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it, for it surpasseth all kind of harmonie, and other contentment whereof the sense is capable. Then his Companion knowinge that there was something supernaturall in this action told him, what representation he had in his sleepe, &amp; how that shortened his sleepe, which the good Fa: hearing sayd to him; Speake nothing of it I pray you, but pray to God that his holy wil be don; so did he flie ostētation, &amp; the more he weakened, &amp; abased his body in the outward man, the more strength, &amp; honor had he in the inward man.</p>
                     <p>This rauishing of spirit, and extraordinary fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his countenance did encrease more as he decayed in body, and as death came on apace, which was a great proofe to make vs beleeue, that he had allreadie tasted some dropp of that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:176965:136"/> heauenlie deuine liquor, wherewith the B. soules are made druncke in Paradise. For this is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the best Deuines in misticall Diuinitie, which is not contrarie to faithe, or reason, that it is possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le, and also permitted, to a good soule, to haue some feelinge of the ioyes of heauen before death, so that it become capable therof with a sincere will, and due preparation. And why not? seeing that God, which is the obiect of our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in what state soeuer we be, seeing allways God in heauen cleerely, and in this life within the obscuritie of faith, can if it please him drawe the curtaine, and represent himselfe without cloude, or obscuritie, not to the eies of our body, which are too terrestriall, but to those of the soule, which are the same, after death or duringe our life.</p>
                     <p>After this extasie he seemed to haue a fresh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, as though he had not felt any euill at all, allthough the heare presently after retiringe from him, he was depriued of the ordinary mouing of his limnes. He earnestly requested that he might receaue the Sacrament of extreme vnction, as the last buckler of defence against the assaults of Sathan, which beinge more firce att such ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, then at any other, make often those that are most strong, to faulter, and faint. His desire was satisfied, and hauinge receaued it with ioyned handes, and his eies lifted vp to heauen, and his hart to God, he spake these wordes worthy to be grauen vpon the marble of eternitie, or rather
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:176965:136"/> in the hearts of deuout soules, that they may make vse of them in such conflicts. <hi>God be blessed, I am now fortified on all sides, and soe well armed from tope to toe, that I do not feare my enimy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Dukes highnes beinge much afflicted for the sicknes of this blessed Father, besides the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, and Apothecarie, who were all waies with him, sent euery day some of his gentlemen to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit him, and assure him of his affection, &amp; to know in what state he was. Therfore he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to entertaine them with spirituall discourse, giuing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hem allwaies some good rule how to liue in Gods grace, amiddest the great splendours of court. His companion seeinge that one of these gentlemen would haue driuē him into a discourse touchinge nobilitie, and esteeminge that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drewe on towards his end, putt him in mind of himselfe and said. <hi>Ab hoc memento pendet eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> Of this moment dependeth eternitie, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the moment of death.</p>
                     <p>These wordes moued him so much, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately throwing himselfe downe to the centre of our naught, he esteemed himselfe one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sinners of the world, and vpon this occasion he made an exhortation of the loue of God, of the nature, qualitie, and fruites of it, and of that, which we are to render in exchange of his person, or in the person of our neighbour in whom his image is represented. And this he vttered with so much feruour, zeale, and deuotion, and strength of lungs, as if he had preached in some pulpitt in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:176965:137"/> good state of health, and he wittnessed to them that his heart putt in practise more then his toung did expresse, soe that the Phisitians and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men who were present hearing him cry so forceably three times. O loue, O loue, O loue of God, his face being all on fire, and his heart ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished on high, could not but exceedingly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this, and said that this seemed to them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the voice of an Angell, then of man.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after he called for the Crucifix, and holding it deuoutly in his handes, his spirit which was not weakened, supplied to him mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of feruent, and deuout meditation of Christs death, and passion till such time, as his forces wholy forsaking him he contented himselfe to say Iesus Maria, with a wonderfull tendernes of sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and yett lett not go his hold of the Crucifix, but kept it in his handes.</p>
                     <p>Presently his tounge which was the instrument of conuersion of soe many soules, and the Angell of consolation, benummed in his palate, ceased to do its proper function halfe an houre before he departed.

                     <p>This was the eight, and twentith day of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1608. the six and fortith of his life, and the two and twentie of his conuersion among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, that he rendered this his talent to God, who had giuen it him and rendered it with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold profitt, which he had gotten by his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. After his death his face changed not in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, his eies lifted vp to heauen seemed to shewe some little smilinge, his armes lay a crosse vpon his stomacke. A man would not haue thought that he had bene dead, if his limmes being all cold had not lost all manner of heate, and feelinge▪ His companion in whose armes he would dy in wittnes of his affection, spake to him as yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge rendered his soule. The Phisitian felt his pulse, and put his hand on his mouth, thinking that his soule was not yet departed, when it was enioyinge the recompence of his meritts. In fine his soule went from him so sweetly, that it gaue no signe of departure by any contraction of the bodie (as is ordinary) but only that it liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now had no life.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes highnes hauinge heard the tidings of his death, being much grieued for the losse of so worthy a personage, purposed to goe, and see him, and honor his funerall with his presence: but his Phisitian diuerted him, because he had seene some spotts vpon the bodie of this good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he thought might be tokens of the purples, and so his highnes might incurre some danger therby. Whereupon he gaue charge to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:176965:138"/> his Phisitian, to see him embalmed, and to putt him into a coffin of leade, and couer it with a cloth of black veluert, desiringe that he might be so buried: as he was in the Chappell of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.</p>

                     <p>WHiles the body of this blessed Father did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at Riuoly, the heauy newes of his death was brought to his daughter Madame the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse, who was much afflicted with the tydings of it. Her loue answerable to his Fatherly loue, would not permitt her, to leaue his bodie so farr of from her, &amp; therfore tooke order that it should be transported to Paris, she sent for this purpose the Gouernor of Dombes in Sauoy, to request the Dukes highnes both in her vncles name the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Ioyouse, as also in her owne, that he would not refuse his consent to the remouinge of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bodie. His highnes accorded to it, yet very sory he was that Piedmont should be depriued of that rich treasure, hauing already foūd &amp; knowen the profitt of it by many effects, whose soule was powerfull to assist the necessities of those, who had recourse to him for his intercession to God. He was taken thence with many teares, and great sorrowe, the Dukes highnes had three sonnes. Monsieur the Prince Maior, Mōseigneur the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:176965:138"/> and Monsieur the prince Thomas, who assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there withall their trayne, and bearinge great torches of white wax in their handes, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the body on foote two miles from Riuoli, doing him this honor due to his pietie, att the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue of his bodie, which they could not do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore att his death, nor at his buriall.</p>
                     <p>There was foure religious of his order which were all ways about his coffin, and followed it (as they had commandement to doe) euen to Paris. Through the villages as they passed, the Curatts with the people came out to meete the Corps in procession: the townes where there were manie Ecclesiasticall persons assembled, they did the like in generall processions, and did thinke it a fauour from heauen, that this precious Iewell passed by them, hopinge to obteyne thereby the influence of some particuler grace by his meanes.</p>
                     <p>When he came to Lyons, the principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the citie came to receaue him, and all the clergie &amp; Religious went out with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of torches, and lightes to conduct him to the Conuent of the Capucins, who were attended with such multitudes of people, that they could hardly passe.</p>
                     <p>Madam Dutchesse of Mercoeur earnestly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Madā the Dutchesse of Guise, that she would lett her haue for a present the heart of her father, to be kept as a precious relique in the Conuent of the religious woemen of S. Clare, called other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise daughters of the passion, which is one of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:176965:139"/> most goodly monasteries of this order, and a wittnes of the great pietie of this Princesse, which caused it to be built in the suburbs of Saint Honore, right against the monasterie of the Capucins, to the erecting whereof, this good Father had contributed all he could by his good aduise, and employement, and had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there the first day, when the first twelue were closed vp, att which time Monseigneur the Cardinall of Gondy performed the rest of the office.</p>
                     <p>There was some difficultie made in yeldinge to this demand, for as much as the heart hauinge ben put, and closed within the body couered with lyme, and some sweete herbes, when his highnes caused it to be embalmed, it was thought that besides the naturall course of all the parts of the bodie, there had ben some corruption cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and hastened by those thinges applyed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these reasons his body was opened againe att Lyons in the presence of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Dombes, of Monsieur President, &amp; some others, and his heart was taken foorth as sound, fresh, and bloud-ruddy, as att the houre of his death, not without great astonishment of all those that sawe it. The same day the office was sayd for him, (as it was in all other places where his body stayed) and the presse of people was so great, and the clamours and cryes soe lowde, both of people without, and within the Church, that a Father of the order being to make
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:176965:139"/> a Funeral oration, was constrayned to begin with these wordes. Silence people, silence.</p>
                     <p>After the office they departed, and went on their way towardes Paris, whereof the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Neuers beinge aduertised, and seeinge so precious a Iewell att their gate, went out to meete him in great toopes, with an incredible reuerence and deuotion. They did him the same honor as he had att Lyons, and the next day the Bishopp withall solemne ceremonye, conducted him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the barke, not without the great shouts of many, and teares of others: in the like manner he was receaued in all places. The eleuenth of Iune his body came to Paris, and was receaued with that respectfull deuotion as may be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, but not expressed. The Capucins went foorth to meete his body a league out of the towne, accōpanied with a great presse of people. All the houshold seruants of Madame the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse his daughter, went foorth also two, and two, on horsebacke in moorninge weedes. The Capucins came after in the same order, euery one carrying a light of white wax in his hand singinge the office, and suffrage for the dead, according to their ordinary manner of plaine songe. After fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the body carried betweene two mules, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a gray cloth as the beere also was with a white Crosse of cloth (for so it was ordered by Monseigneur Cardinall de Ioyeuse accordinge to the direction herein from his holines) And there followed a great companie of Knightes of the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:176965:140"/> two orders of the Kinge. Amonge other Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Duke of Espernon his brother in lawe. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur le Grand the master of horse, Mōsieur de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelaure, and many others, in whose face a man might haue reade the sorrowe of their harts, not for the losse only of so worthie a kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but such a spirituall Father, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe his life taught them the way to heauen by his holy exhortations, and encouraged them to surmont al difficulties with manly courage what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they were, by his extraordinary manner of vertuous life. It was thought that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue an hundred thousand persons, within the street, or in windowes, or Coaches, who were the beholders of the reception of his bodie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these great multitudes, att Paris there were fourteene parishes which accompanied him from the country round about, and the deuotion of many was so great towardes him, that they could not be kept from cuttinge some little parcells of the cloth which couered the biere, takinge also the floures wherwith it was sett, to keepe them as reliques.</p>
                     <p>The Capucins watched all the night about the body, and the next day had a solemne seruice, wherat Madame de Guise his daughter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who by her constancie made knowen a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue surpassinge nature: all the principall Signeurs were also present. After the seruice he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the high altar of the Capucins, where they haue permitted contrary to the custome of

                     <p>GOd is pleased to honor much his frinds, and when it pleaseth him he rayseth them to the topp of greatnes, and maketh their actions soe much more honorable, and memorable amonge men, as they haue sought to keepe them hidden from the eies of men, when they performed them. But as there ar diuerse waies to come to heauen, so God draweth vs, by diuerse contrary meanes, as his grace freely giuen are diuerse, and vocations much differinge one from an other. For some take the way of Angelicall counsells, others do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues with treadinge the great beaten way of Gods commandements. In fine as in the heauenly Hierusalem there are twelue ports, by which euery Christian soule may, if it will, enter, so, God vseth diuerse meanes to make knowen the glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y of his elect: his purpose is but one which he hath to make appeere glorious, but his waies to that end are diuerse by which he carrieth them, and bringeth them to haue glory. He maketh great account of prompt obedience to their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, as that was of S. Mathewe. In others he maketh the effects of an extraordinary conuersion shine most brightly, as he did towards S. Mary Magdalene. He guideth some others by the paths of some willdernes as he did S. Hilarion. Some
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:176965:141"/> other by the waye of pouertie as S. Frācis. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth some to be renowned for miracles as S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, who was before surnamed Thaumaturgus, which is a worker of wonders, and all these by the greatnes of the glory, which now they enioy.</p>
                     <p>By this we may guesse what crowne of glory this B. Father hath receyued, &amp; with what honor we ought to celebrate his memory; for what voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more deuine then his? For his conuersiō (I do not speake from sinne to grace, but from the world to religion) what more prompt? for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were they not many, and most eminent?</p>
                     <p>But some wil aske what miracles hath he don? the discourse of this I haue reserued for this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. How many Saints are there in heauen, which haue done no miracles? Iesus Christ conuersinge amonge men, did commend much the sanctitie of S. Iohn Baptist aboue all others, and yet the holy scripture doth not make mētion of any miracle of his. It is God which doth them, to wittnes to men, the greatnes of his elect, which being well knowen by the excellency of their vertues, he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth extraordinary things: so that although Fa. Angell neuer had done, nor euer should do any miracle, there were no more doubt to be made of his sāctitie, thē if he should do hūdreds euery day. For who will dare to cal in question, whether his B. soule be in heauen? that soule I say that hath despised honors, trampled vnder his feete worldly dignities, giuen the defie to fortune: that soule to whom delights haue ben bitter, pleasures haue ben
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:176965:142"/> troubles, contentments afflictions, the world a feareful desert, and the court a hell ful of tortures. That soule which euē from the cradle sought the way to heauen, and warily obserued the wayes which it did tread, and left not it selfe in the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of marriage, that soule which being masked with the false visard of temporal honors, saw not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge her owne good, and was able to discerne it from false semblances, &amp; also embrace it constantly. That soule, whose vertues were greater, then his noble race, &amp; of great courage in subduinge passions, as in conquering his enemies. That soule that checked the pride of his mate the body by great austerities, &amp; mortifications, which tooke repose, and comfort, where sensuall men finde great paine, and labour. That soule to which prayer was foode, and nourishment, disciplines sweete contentments, fastings were banquets, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances comforts, trauaile good entertainmēt, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, was his delight, obedience was authoritie, pouertie was riches, a hard strawe bed was softer then a Downe bedd, a little cell, a goodly palace, and a cloister was a city, where he had the vtmost heaped measure, and accomplishment of his harts desire. That soule patient in afflictions, modest in all occasions, humble amonge thē of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessiō, burning in the loue of God, charitable tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards his neighbour, benigne, &amp; officious towards euery one, prompt to serue God, first in the quire, and in all good exercises. That soule that was prudent in the conductinge it selfe and other. To
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:176965:142"/> be briefe, that holy soule, which within the vessell of a humaine body, led an Angells life, whose cleannes exceeding the sun beames, shal serue for a light of comfort to those that will open their eies, to behold the beauty of it. And should this soule after so many graces be frustrated of glory? What then shall become of those vertues, auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, fastings, mortifications, prayers, watchings, disciplines, exhortations, and voyages? what shall become of his honors despised, riches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, dignities bannished, and great fortunes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned? shall that patience serue him for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, when he suffered his beard to be pluckt contemptuously? shall that humility want exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which lodged in a poore stable? that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour shall it be without fruit, which made the blood flowe from his body by sharpe chastice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? shall not that pouertie be richly rewarded, which made him begg, &amp; endure hunger, where he might haue bene plentifully, and delicately treated? that loue of God, and charitie towards his neighbour, which made him leese his ordinary refection, shall they be floures without bringinge foorth fruite? Those extasies, holy rapts, ano mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique of Angels heard of him a little before death, shall it end with his life? shall Father Angell be depriued of the vision, and sight of God, who was alwaies the obiect of his thoughts, his desires, his actions, while he was a pilgrime in this life? No certainely. God is a rewarder of good deedes, he hath promised heauen to those, which shal follow
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:176965:143"/> that waie which he hath traced one to vs, and those that followe neere to him. If one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers durst assure vs, that the conuersion of a sinner was more to God, then the production of all things vpon earth, then certainly all those, who by diuerse graces giuen to them, haue had that blessing to cooperat, and cause the conuersion of soules which goe astraie, do by consequence so many miracles. Vpon this foundation, this B. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said, that the comming of God into a soule by grace, did in some manner exceed the comming of Iesus Christ into humaine flesh. For (said he) our Sauiour comming into the world, only the second person of the Trinitie became man, vniting it selfe to our nature: but in the soule al the three persons of the Trinitie come, for as much as they three doe concure indiuisibly, to the creation of man, so do they indiuisibly concure to his iustification, and all three do adorne his soule with graces, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; giftes; The Father giueth perfection to the memory, the Son to the vnderstandinge, and the holy Ghost to the will. The Father communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth power to him to resist his enemies, the Son wisedome to discerne good, from bad, the holy Ghost goodnes to embrace the one, and fly the other. The Father maketh the soule his daughter, the Son maketh it his sister, &amp; the holy Ghost his spouse. The Father created it, the Son redeemed it, and the holy Ghost sanctifieth it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The comminge of Iesus Christ in the flesh was visible by his conuersation among men, but
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:176965:143"/> the comming of him into a soule inuisibly, is not only to other, but to him who receaueth him. For that is true which Salomō saith, that a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether he be worthy of loue or hate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The cōming of our Sauiour in the flesh was for all, for the good, and bad, for the iust, and vniust, but his spirituall comming into the soule, is not but for the iust, for God is an enemy of sinne, and will not lodge in a sinfull soule.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The cōming of our Sauiour into this world, was for a little time, not that he would leaue the humanity which he had taken, but because he died shortly, &amp; risen againe ascended into heauen: but the comming of the most holy Trinitie into a soule is perpetuall on their part. God neuer forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any soule if he be not forsaken first.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The comminge of the Son of God into the world, and the descent of the holy Ghost, and all the misteries of our faith haue bene ordained, for the dwelling of the most holy Trinitie with vs by grace in this world, and eternally in heauen by glorie.</p>
                     <p>Finally this comminge of the most holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into the soule is of so great importance that all that the Son of God hath don in this world, all that he hath endured, and wrought outwardly for the loue of vs, profiteth vs nothing without it. For what avayleth it a man that God was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, what benefit is thereof his bloud, his death, his merits, his sending of the holy Ghost, and all the rest, if he goe to hell? What contentment (said
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:176965:144"/> old Tobie) can I haue in the light of the sunne. I that am blind, and cannot see it? In like manner, what contentment can a sinner haue, which dieth in these darknes without the light of grace, which proceedeth from the sunne of righteousnes, and for which end he came into the world? In this manner did this Father discourse of the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace in our soule as miraculous.</p>
                     <p>Miracles are certainely one marke of sanctitie, but they alone are not sufficient to proue it, we must know if the life of him whom God doth vse to manifest his greatnes be answerable, in pious &amp; holy conuersation to such effects. He hath vsed sinners in this kind, as he prophesied by the mouth of Balaam and Caiphas, both of them being bad, and impious men. He may do the like for secrett causes which are knowen to him only, so that this is not a sufficient argument to proue thereby the holines of a good soule, that God worketh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by his meanes, but rather the exercise of vertue, extraordinary mortifications, the rigor of penāces, the daily practisinge of good &amp; vertuous workes, the continual victory ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r al his passions, all this proceeding from a particuler grace, and no common charitie of those that put it in executiō, is an assured testimonie of sanctitie, which is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and made visible to men by miracles.</p>
                     <p>And what hath ben the life of B. Fa. Angel, but a perpetual miracle, whereas it is naturally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that a body so tenderly bred, in the delicacys, &amp; pleasure of the Court, could subsist in the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:176965:144"/> of soe many austerities, with so chearefull a countenance allways, &amp; with so noble a courage as he did, if there had not ben some thinge more thē ordinary in him. I might recite many in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, but because the religious of his order haue neglected to make any collection of thē, or proofe by the signinge of witnesses beinge iuridically examined, there might be doubt made that they were not authenticall, and of creditt, and therfore I do lett them passe in silence. Besides my desire is no other but to excite by the reading hereof good soules to compunction, &amp; to pietie, to austeritie of life, to the rarity, and excellencie of his vertue, to the despisinge of those things that the world most esteemeth, such examples do more then miracles.</p>
                     <p>And yet if we require them, what greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then that nine months after his buriall, his hart should be taken out of his body so sound, so fresh without any ill odour, as it is att this presēt, in the Conuent of the Daughters of the passion, kept in a box of gold made in the fashiō of a hart, and couered with a Christall of the same figure, through which it may be seene, al which is don by the deuotion of Madame de Guise.</p>
                     <p>For my part I dare avowe for a truth, that of all proofe to declare the felicitie of a blessed soule, the most certaine is finall grace, on what part the tree shall fal (sayd the son of God) it wil lye, he would say that our life being like to a tree (because we liue as plants) death being cōming to cutt of the rootes, if we be in grace we are assured to possesse

As long as we liue, we are still in danger of fallinge, if we be this day in the state of grace, to morrowe sin may enter. A man may be now Gods frind, and in a moment after his enemie, one that hath tresured vp manie merits, yelding to one tentation may leese it in an instant, and dying in that state, he is made compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Lucifer in eternall flames: the reason of it is because, as longe as we liue, we are free, and in the hands of our counsell. God leaueth vs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene fire and water, to reach to which we will. Good and euill are the obiects of our actions. If our affections incline to good we are happie, if to euill, we are in miserable state: we cannot accuse God of our ill that befalleth vs, our perdition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from our selues, wherfore to dy in the state of grace, and as this B.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176965:155"/> with the iniquitye of the tyme, abounding with vitious and lewed libertins, that it could hardly bee discerned and condemned for such; For euen as black beeing neere to white, doth more playnly appeare, soe when it is mixed and confounded with black, it can hardly bee distinguished: The same may I say truely of my lyfe, the darkenes whereof compared with the candor of the life of old Christians, or the puritie of those that are good in this age, would presently bee diseouered: yett hauing ledd my life in the black darkenes of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, it seemed not soe fowle as indeede it is: For since the lamentable change of he Catholique fayth into heresye, since the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and contempt of the vniuersall Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Roman fayth in our Realme, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men haue beene soe stretched and enlarged, the reyne of concupiscence hath beene soe slackned, that all honestie, vertue, and good life, hath beene forsaken and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and on the contrary side, vice and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye hath wholie swayed and ouerruled the same. I would to God my words were not true, but experience doth manifestly shewe, what I say to bee but truth:</p>
                     <p>For first of all, how are mens consciences stretched in traffiquing one with an other? How litle, or noe fidelity, is there now in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall promises? what cunning dealing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage, is there practised euere where? what

Neede wee not now more bonds and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to borow but twentye angells, then was needfull in tyme paste to buy soe much land for euer? Noe man trusteth his neighbour, neyther would I counsell him to truste him: As for sacred oathes, which ought to bee inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, alas men make marchandize of them, and sell them for monye: And for concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, whoe seeth not that it is withheld by noe bridle, men following theyr liberty and pleasures, like brute beastes? But for this I had rather passe it ouer slghtly, then to prooue it by many particular examples: And why should it bee bridled or kept in, if (without giuing any consent vnto it) it be iudged a mortall sinne, as master Charke and other ministers his companions doe teach? and that all wee doe, are mortall Sinnes, as Protestants hold?</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, if any man giue almes, or doe performe any other good worke, hee shall not bee reputed a freind of protestants, but be est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eemed; (as they ordinarilie terme it) a merit-monger: and one that seeketh to saue himselfe by his merits: As for Hospitalitye and releife of the poore, it is almost quite neglected, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among theyre church men, who ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mayntayne theyre wiues or concubines, vpon the goods of the churche.

And finally to vse the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of the Sacraments against sinne, is reputed enmitye against the state: but to confesse, to reconcile others, or to bee reconciled, yea but to carry about him holy things, as Agnus Dei, Medalls, a Crucifix or graines that are blessed, or but to bee in companye with a priest, this is noe lesse then a crime of trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

As for defamation, detraction and rash iudgments, men make noe account or recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them; what diuisions and debates are there in euery parish? And for the moste parte the minister is a principall man in mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them: If wee speake of couetousnes; is not hee to bee iudged a theefe, which desireth the goods, lands and possessions of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I meane in the presence of God? and who bee there among them, whoe lye not still in ambush, and secretly suborne spies, to informe them, how they may take any lest aduantage, how to seaze vpon other mens goods?</p>
                     <p>I will omitte to speake of Iustice, which is corrupted among the principall Iustices, and it is not long since they accused one an other in theyr highest court of Iustice: This is but too euident, when wee see dayly soe many

                     <p>AFter I had long liued in this licentious manner like a libertin, and that it pleased God of his infinite mercy, to recall mee, in the sommer time, according to my wonted manner, I purposed to goe into the contrey to my friends to recreat and delight my selfe with those sportes wherein youth delighteth, and beeing come to the howse of a friend of mine my minde was wholly changed, and alienated form any sportes at all: For three or fowre dayes after I came thither, it happened that I lighted on a litle booke, which I was curious to looke vpon, and finding that it was a booke which I had heard much commended, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Resolution to liue well, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently mooued to reade some fewe passages in the same, yet without any purpose to reade exactly all what soeuer might bee contained in it; and after I had read some litle therof, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to see the end whereat hee aimed, which was a present and speedie reformation of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176965:161"/> life of the reader: where vpon I was desirous to see what arguments hee vsed to perswade ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; if peraduēture I liked them well, I would putt them in practise. But in reading, I began to haue a remorse of conscience, and therefore I left the booke for the present, with a purpose to reade more therof the next day the which was sunday. But when sunday was come I spent it in going to the prayers of Heretiques, and partly in some recreations, and the day after I read very litle or nothing at all. But on tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I tooke the booke againe into my hands, and I read therin many pages, during which time I laboured to fauour my selfe, as though those torments which were threatned to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not touching mee, although my conscience reprooued mee therein. But the more, I read, the more my conscience accused mee, soe that I began to assigne and limitt a time wherein I would amende my life.</p>
                     <p>But what shall I say, o Lord whilst I did not answere sufficiently to thy holy inspirations. thou didst not cease to knock harder at the gate of my harte, soe that I began to finde my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science extreamely oppressed, and by that meanes I became sadd &amp; melancholli{que} Then did I feele my hart perced with greefe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, knowing that with these pleasures on the one side I liued ill, on the other side I would not forsake them; and reading on still, I found euasions to passe them ouer the more slightly.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176965:162"/> At the length, hauing read the Chapter which treated of the account wee muste make to God, I was forced in spight of my teethe to apply this to my selfe, this touched mee soe neare, and soe shooke my conscience, that I beeing not able to dissemble or colour the matter any longer, was driuen to confesse that I was the sinner againste whome these horrible paines and torments of hell were denounced. And from that time I sawe the miserable state wherin I was, and soe sought to amēde my life paste. But alas, how many blocks lay in my way?

Heereafter you shall haue better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie. and shall doe it more easily; you are yet in the flowre of youre age, and what a folly is it to depriue your selfe wholly of youre pleasures and conforts? And what will your friends say to this, when they shall see you growe soe sober and sadd, yow will lees your creddit among those whoe esteeme you, and among the wise you will bee reputed for a foole; Againe when you shall haue tried, you will finde it impossible to absteine from your accustomed sinnes. A good life is extreame hard and vnsupportable: looke about you, and see if there bee any that liueth in that manner that you determine to doe. How can you liue without greate or small sinnes, sithe ministers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176965:162"/> say, All sinns are mortall? Away with these pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish thowghts, by only faith thou maist bee saued, what neede is there of soe many things? In this manner my enemie assayled mee, and I beleeued a long time, that those were greate arguments of right reason, rather then sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of the Deuill.</p>
                     <p>I was vehemently tempted by transitory pleasures, and the vanities of the worlde held mee in thraldome: soe that this my new desire, was not yet strong enough to ouercome the contrary, which was rooted in mee by long custome. The delights of the worlde did allure mee, and the torments of hell did affright mee; Gods inspirations did call mee, but the flesh, the worlde and the deuill staied mee; soe that my two wills, one newe, the other old, the one spirituall, the other carnall, diuided my soule; finding by experience in my selfe, how the flesh coueted against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. I continewed three or fowre daies in this perplexed agonie, but I would not in this conflict auoid the occasions; I lamented and bewailed with teares this my vnhappy state, yet my soule refused to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed wholly into thy hands. It feared like death a perfect renunciation of the world, and while this combat dured, I thought I could not subsist without my wonted pleasures.</p>
                     <p>Thus the temptor beeing very strong &amp; well armed, inuaded mee: but thy goodnes o lord
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176965:163"/> bridled his furie and strengthened mee, that hee did not wholly ouercome mee. This deuill I say appeared vnto mee transformed into an Angell of light, but thou didst lighten mee to knowe him well, and in the end among these dolours, and oppressions, thy goodnes gaue mee this inspiration, that although a vertuous life were very hard and sharpe, yet liuing well I should haue some good hope to enioie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where as liuing in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

By reason wereof I tooke hart, and brake with violence all those chaines and cordes which held mee soe fast tied to the worlde; which mine enemie seeing, began to lay a newe battery against mee, which was, to sett before me his dangerous doctrine of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, telling mee flatly that I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated to bee damned, and all that I could doe was but vaine, and saying to mee that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I were forward in well doing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewed some yeares therin yet if I were not predestinated to bee saued I should bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the end. O how this troubled mee, I was very neere to haue beene swallowed vp in this dangerous abisse: But thy hand o lord, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered mee by this inspiration, that on my parte I ought to doe my duety, and soe I should trie

And I was driuen to confesse this, hauing knowen many that had highly commended it. and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited nothing by it: presumest thou (said the enemy) that thou hast more force then they? while I was thus troubled, I retired my selfe as I was accustomed into a solitary place, to the end I might haue better commodity to bewaile my miserable condition: Thou o lord knowest with how many teares, sobs, and groanes I powred forth my soule vnto thee. At the length lying downe vnder a tree neare vnto a hedge where I purpofed to continue my teares and lamentings, till I receaue some experimentall grace, as indeed I found, thou heardst my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: In this course of tentations I cannot but remēber how euery morning as soone as I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, this onsett was giuen mee a fresh; and then I felt my selfe very melancholique, and

O said I, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite labour is this? Into what an intricat la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth am I fallen?

Furthermore because I feared lest the circumstances of my sinfull life, might barre mee from obtaining this grace, I examined my selfe often by the rule of the twelue fruits of the holy Ghost which were written in this booke, and when I found my selfe defectuous, I striued to an amendment.</p>

Are not these horses some spirits? Hauing gone some dozen paces, and looking behind mee, I sawe nothing of that which I formerly sawe, but there succeded in the same place a greate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poore people, ill cladd in browne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of whome some carried white wallets on theire shoulders, some other greate leather bottels in theire hands: I was more troubled at this sodaine change then I was before, and therefore turning my selfe towards them, I sett my selfe to behould them wishly, and hauing taken a good viewe of them for a good space as I went on, I thought that they might bee hay-makers for that it was the season wherin
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176965:166"/> such did trauaile, and soe I perswaded my selfe in very deede; In this perswasion I held on my way, &amp; could not but wonder what that might bee, that seemed to mee a multitude of horses, and what was become of them; which although I had discussed with my selfe a long time I could receaue noe satisfaction. Immediatly I turned againe, and loked back towards the same place, and all was vanished, and in their place I sawe a well ordered companie of men and children, all clad in a whitish colour: vpon the sight of them I made as much speede as I could to goe vnto t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

At length I sawe them clearely and beheld them perfectly: They were all clad alike with a kinde of vestment, like to long gownes with wide sleeues; The colour of theire gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was a white gray Theire robe had vpon it from the neck to the girdle, a thing which I might liken to a spanish cloake; they had theire robes girt to them, and some of them vnder their garments, wore as it were a white robe like to a surplis, with greate and wide sleeues made of linnen, and vpon their head they wore greate hatts all of the same fashion, and of the same colour as were their robes. The men were in the midst, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on both sides; Soe went they in order all

After a good space of time I staied my selfe. and closed my eies to the end that I might behoulde them better and more clearely; then opening my eies I beheld them as before, and then I mended my pace towards them, thinking that if they went on, they would staie at a hedge which was now very neere to them, and then I should vnderstand what all this meant. But beeing come thither, I sawe nothing at all, but in an other closse before mee, I sawe one of the greatest of this company all alone, and presently hee vanished, and I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home: In goyng homeward I was musing with my selfe, &amp; earnestly laboured to searche the meaning of this, and framed diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: but o good God thou wouldest not that I should knowe, the exposition of it, thou knewest that it was much better for mee, that the knowledg of it should bee suspended: and therefore all the declarations that I or others could make, were litle to the purpose, till such time as it was manifested to mee in fitt time

The next morning early wee went togither towards London, and in the way hee tooke occasion often in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to perswade mee to his religion. Amōg other matters of discourse, hee spake of a booke which the Protestants faigned to haue beene found in a corner of a wall, which was of an

Hee said that this booke was alleadged often in pulpits as a booke of greate authoritie and of noe small moment to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theire Ghospell, and yett the same booke a litle after was recalled by themselues to their shame, and confusion; Afterward I vnderstood that this was a true historie.</p>
                     <p>Hee spake also of a certayne exorcisme done by a Catholique Priest, and related many other strange and meruailous things done in it, and how finally the deuill was caste out of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed person, and restored to former health; but yet of this I doubted much.

Hee had this speeche with mee and much other to drawe mee from the newe religion, although I yet held my firme purpose to follow the course of my studie, as the principall foundation vpon which I would build my knowledge.</p>
                     <p>All this time that wee were together, I did call to minde my life paste, and in the end brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of a depth of my inward thoughts, I sodainly cried out and said. O if I had died heeretofore what had become of mee for all

O lord I beseeche thee giue mee grace that I may neuer cease to thanke thee for soe greate &amp; meruailous deliuerances, from such extreame and desperate dangers Then I began to recite to my companion, how when I was very litle, I brake by chance my back bone, and yet by the goodnes of God I recouered my health. An other time how falling into a dangerous maladie, and almost despairing of recouering my selfe, by reason of 4. or 5. incisions which were also to bee reiterated in so much that my bowells were seene, and therefore the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion said that hee had litle hope of life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing by Gods greate goodines, I was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and escaped this daunger.

I fell into soe deepe meditation of these things, and of my life past, that I did not suffer my spirit to occupy it selfe in any other thing: And if by chance I looked vpon the fields to take a litle recreation, I did presently reprooue my selfe sharpely for it, fearing to offende the, o my God; And in considering these things, I could hardly forbeare weeping, and chiefely when I came to the citty of London where those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were represented to mee, wherein I had vainely delighted my selfe, and at length restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning teares as long as I could, I shedd them in greate aboundance, soe that meeting some of my old companions, I pluckt downe my hart, and held downe my head, through shame and confusion in my selfe.

Thy grace so fortifyed mee a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I thought there was nothing able for to shake mee: Nowe thou hast turned thy face frō mee, and I was presently troubled; I perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my selfe that I was somewhat, although I was euē lesse then nothing; I said I will become wise, and straight way I became a very foole; I doe now knowe that without the ayd of thy holy grace wee can doe nothing; It is certein that vnles thou keepe the cittie, in vayne doth hee travayle which thinketh to keepe it; The grace which thy goodnes doth communicate to vs, is measured by thy wisdome, which will nor permitt that wee bee allwaies assisted alike in our praiers; so that now putting my selfe on my knees to pray, I had not the feeling of my wonted feruour, but contrariwise I found my selfe very vnapt, and loathed more and more to perseuer in it; Besides I felt a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and anxiety of spirit, which did much trouble mee.</p>
                     <p>Now my enemy began to play his parts, for hee seeing that noe thing held mee but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the true Religion, hee tooke occasion to vexe mee that so hee might more easily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme mee: Therefore hee obiected to mee, that I vndertooke too hard a matter, saying, that the resolution of it, is too high a matter, and far exceeding my capacitie, for if learned

The second heauenly Hierarchie cōsisteth in three orders: Dominations, Powers and Principalities, and these are illuminated not immediatly from god, but from the Superiour Angells, &amp; they illuminate those that ar vnder them.

                     <p>Thirdly the beautfull and maiestatiue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of thy Church seemed to mee to giue much splendour to it: for when I sawe the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of the masse celebrated with Preist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176965:178"/> thy holy Churche.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly good Lord, soe greate was my inward melting sweetenes, when I heard the harmonious musick of voices &amp; organs, which with himnes and canticles were offered to thy diuine maiestie, that my harte could not but leape with ioye, &amp; was violently drawen from all worldly thoughtes, &amp; coulde not containe the ioye, but often melted into aboundance of teares, soe that my eyes seemed to bee two channells running from a plentifull fountain, and that I might truly say with thy seruant Saint Augustine: How often haue I wept fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my selfe liuely touched with those sweete Canticles and Hymnes which are song in thy Church, with soe sweete and well beseeming Harmonie. Thou seest, o God, how my harte trembleth when I call to minde these soe great benefits, pardon therefore my ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>All these former things seemed to mee, to be full of grauitie, beautie, and magnificence, in thy Churche, and the rather beeing now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liured frō those infernall blasphemies, which are belched out of the mouthes of many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ministers: &amp; now liuing in a Catholicque Country with greate tranquillitie and repose of spirit, I heard also, o Lord, thy sweete voice which did inuite mee more clearely to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of a religious solitary and priuate life, by quite abandoning all worldly affaires, yet doubting of a matter of so greate importance,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176965:178"/> forasmuch as I had heard it said that it was not lawfull to beleeue euery Spirit, I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it to some of my best freinds, asking theyre aduise and iudgment heerein, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, differed in theyre opinions: some persuaded mee to one thing, and some to an other, and all of them were litle or nothing inclined to this kinde of life which I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to imbrace; for they persuaded mee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I should continue in the worlde where as I was minded to forsake it.</p>
                     <p>But, o Lord, thou gauest mee soe many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations and motions to followe thy holy inspiration, that in the end after I had borne much affliction by contrary persuasious, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to putt it in execution, my first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was founded vppon the wordes of the Ghospell which saith, <hi>The way is straight and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which leadeth to life &amp; there are fewe which walke in it;</hi> &amp; I sett before my eies the great debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and disorders of most mens liues in this time. I afterward considered the extreame danger that is in the worlde where there are occasions of falling and plunging into sinne, &amp; how for this cause the Christians of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church (which in respect of theise of our times were saincts) how, I say, they seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred themselues from the worlde, and how some striuing to bee more perfitt, fledd into deserts and wildernesses, fearing least among men they might defile theyre soules with some
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176965:179"/> fowle stayne of sinne; How much more ought I poore and fraile creature retire my selfe to some monasterie, to separate my selfe from christians whoe liue soe licentiously.</p>
                     <p>Besides I called to minde the greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of soules, which I had left in England, my familiar freinds with whome I had liued, and many millions of others seeing them all to passe this pilgrimage in miserable blindnes, going like straying sheepe thorough the thick darkenes of heresie and schisme, and my selfe worse then others, to bee deliuered from such captiuitie; when I considered this I felt such a fire of charitie kindled within mee, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately I was forceably moued to retire my selfe from the worlde. Moreouer although I was called to thy holy seruice yet I was not vnmindfull of those wordes which say. <hi>Many are called but fewe are chosen.</hi> This serued for a spurre and goade to driue mee to a more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and perfitt life then that which I did lead; To these considerations I added that it was no small thing to expect cternall glory, to come to which, wee must passe thorough wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fire.</p>
                     <p>And lastly to answere well to my extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling I thought I must embrace and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake more then an ordinary life, and my life past licentiously spent ought to bee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced proportionably by penance in this life or the next, for this is agreeable to that which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176965:179"/> is written in holy scripture; <hi>As much as shee hath glorified her selfe and hath beene in delicatie, soe much giue her torment and mourning:</hi> and an ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour saith, that a deepe wounde requireth a deepe tent; These things I say stirred mee vpp to doe penance and to followe the counsell which our sauiour giueth in the Ghospell; <hi>If thou wilt bee perfect goe and sell all that thou hast and giue them to the poore and thou shalt haue a treasure in heauen.</hi> These and such things, o Lord, came not from mee, but proceeded from thy pure and free liberalitie, to strengthen mee in the course of my begunne life, and to confirme in mee that vowe which thy goodnes had begun in mee: For which all praise, glory and honour bee rendered to thy holy name.</p>

                     <p>ALthough I had made before with my selfe, a firme resolution to become a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, of the order of Sainct Francis, yet I was in greate doubt whether I shoulde take the habit of the Cordeliers, or of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, not knowing well which of these two
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176965:181"/> did moste followe Saint Francis; I sawe well the life of the Capucins to bee more austere and strict, yet I knewe not whether they did more perfectly obserue the rule of Sainct Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and whether they did weare his true habit or noe, and inclined rather to thinke that they did not; so I thought to enter into the religion of the Cordeliers, and yet obseruing that they liued not soe austerely as the Capucins, I was troubled, and thought I shoulde hardly satisfy my selfe in following Saint Francis soe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as I desired. After I had a lōg tyme made, a diligent and exact inquisition hereof, I founde my selfe notwithstanding very doubtfull, soe that I once purposed to haue gone to Rome to vnderstand it more clearely, euen from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines owne mouth: but I thought it beste at length to goe first to Paris, and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with men of the one and the other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where I tooke resolution to take the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Capucin, following the aduise &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of a Capucin, which before had beene a Cordelier, and came out of that order to liue more austerely.</p>

The sinceritie which without partialitye I vsed in searching the true faith, &amp; my firme purpose to study, fast, pray, lye vpon the hard ground, and other austerities which I practised, from whence did they issue, but from an aboundance of thy grace? And to see how it pleased thee without all these, sodainly to reueale, the truthe vnto me, this I say, maketh mee much astonished, and to knowe certainly that thou art truly neere to those whoe call vpon thee, and that whosoeuer shall reueale his

                     <p>IT is noe meruayle if Father BENNETT shewed so great feruour among the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins, since that from the instant of his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there was allwayes in him a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deuotion: Hee was as a coale all on fire, which did kindle others with his glowing heate, but the violence appeared farre more after, when hee had liued in the obseruance of so straight a rule: so that it may bee truely said of him, that the change which hee made from a secular life to a religious, was but to giue a more ample externall testimonie of the true Apostolicall life which hee would after lead, and to binde himselfe by solemne vowes, to those actions which hee did practise already of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176965:187"/> his owne free will, and of a holy affection and merit of life.</p>
                     <p>Hee spake himselfe in the narration of his cōuersion, what pleasure hee tooke in visiting churches, and behoulding theire buildings and outward ornamente, but his humility forbad him to speake how hee passed wholle dayes heerein, not knowing how the time went away which was spent so, hee signified the vnspeakeable contentment which hee had in hearing the musick, how hee was so changed thereby that teares trikling downe his cheeks hee fell often into thankes giuing to God, that hee had made him in some manner vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what the ioyes, of heauen should bee, since hee was soe much affected with that sweete harmonye heere in earth but humble as hee was, and hiding diligently the graces which might cause him honor, hee did not declare how these pleasures putte him into such extasies that hee did not remember where hee was. At Doway when hee made his first restraint, and excercised his first deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his soule (which knewe not as yet in what manner to proceede according to Gods holy intention to the attaining of perfection) so gaue it selfe to contemplation that many can not match him after the long practise of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life in the cloisters.</p>
                     <p>Itt happened then as hee was on his knees praying bare headed, his hands ioined, and his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176965:187"/> harte and eies lifted vp to God, his soule was rauished as the hymnes were sōg in the Church his body was left as vnsensible for the time, insomuch that lifting vpp himselfe sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee went from the place where hee was, leauing his hatt and glooues behinde him, not perceauing it till hee came to the Churche porch, so that hee was faine to retire thither where hee had praied, to seeke his hatte and glooues.</p>
                     <p>What a change was this, that an Heretique, a yong man, and a gentleman, being but newly come out of heresy, and yet retaining the other two, should bee so deuout, and so deepely roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in such acts of deuotion? What a change is this, to see him frequente Churches in stead of daunces, sermons in stead of Comedies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in stead of prophane companie, and to take delight in spirituall songs and hymnes in stead of youthfull, vitious, &amp; wanton songs? To turne banquetting and feasting into fasting? to become a freind of solitude? to bee retired and recollected? hauing all waies God before the eyes of his spirit, to whose will hee rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his thoughts, affections and actions cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: Noe man can well consider this vnlesse he confesse that the secrets of God are very greate, and that hee did designe this blessed Father to some thing extraordinary, and of high reach during the rest of his life, seeing that the beginning of his conuersion, was suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured

This was the cause that this good Father beeing disquieted with the worlde, wherein hee had taken soe much delight, made his first resolution to bee a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, to which God drewe him by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers visions, inspirations, lights of the spirit, and kindling of the will, as hee reported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when hee was perplexed which of the two religions (the Cordeliers or the Capucins) did obserue perfectly the rule of Sainct Frācis, and did weare his true habitt, wheerein God inspired him soe manifestly, that hee could not admit any doubt, touching this inspiration as a religious man of this order hath related, and signed with his owne hand whose name was Peter Edwards an Irish man of nation, his very familiar and inward freind, to whome hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it one tyme, as they entertained discourse one with an other, vpon the particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts toward certeine persons.</p>
                     <p>One day as hee was in a deepe meditation touching this buisines, and not knowing what to resolue, hee praied and commended this to God with all possible feruour, and with all the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176965:188"/> faculties of his soule, not without many deepe grones of his harte, and salte teares falling From his eyes, there appeared to him an Angell most beautifull and glorious, compassed with a great light, and a booke in his hand which hee opening without speaking one worde to him, made a signe to him to read that which was within. Hee looked vpon it and read these wordes, O lord how difficil &amp; hard is this way which thou hast shewed to mee? The Angell turned the leafe and he read the same thing in it, and soe turning ouer all the leafes found the same words written, vpon this the Angell va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of his sight, and his soule was left full of consolation and ioye assuring himselfe that it was Gods will, that hee shoulde bee a Capucin, because theire manner of life was more strict and austere then that of the Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, though they bee both the children of B. Sainct Francis, &amp; make profession of the same rule. After this redoubling the feruour of his praiers, hee said o God how good art thou, and soe lay as a man rapt in the contemplation of soe greate a benefit, which hee would not haue changed for all the wealth of the world.</p>
                     <p>After this time hee could finde noe content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but in their cloisters, making his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage betweene the houses of Paris and Mendon, and when hee was with them hee thought himselfe in Paradise, &amp; neuer rested till they had r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Capucins seeing soe greate feruour in this yong gentleman and a stranger, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the habit did not knowe what to thinke of it, for hee not willing to reueale to them the visions and inspirations which hee had from God to drawe him to religion, told them only that his desire was to forsake the worlde, that the litle experience which hee had of the worlde was sufficient to make him des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise it, that hee did foresee that in religion hee should haue more meanes to keepe downe the body by mortifications, and hee was not ignorant what proffit redoundeth thereby to the soule if hee were tyed in the chaines of a holy rule: and in the end hee knew how greate a crowne of glory did belong to those, that had liued in the holy obseruance therof. These considerations ouerweighed all others, yea if the whole worlde had beene putt into the other scale, this had ouerweighed it; But yet for all this he was delayed and putte off, that so it might the better appeare, whether hee were truly mooued by Gods holy spirit, or whether some worldly discontentment did not make him to change his life &amp; profession; for among
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:176965:189"/> the Capucins, religious are not easily receaued; yea I haue knowen some that haue sought to bee receaued for fiue or six yeares together, and euery yeare haue made iourneies of fowrscore or a hundred leages, to make sure to their Prouinciall chapter, before that they haue been receaued and happily they had not soe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly perseuered, if they had beene receaued at their first requeste, forasmuch as wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue those things with more circumspection which haue coste vs much paine and trauaile to gett them; but hee wonne them at the length to admitte him without any more delaies. At that time hee was but fowre and twentie years of age; which though it be the time when nature is in her greatest violence, and seeketh moste her pleasure, yet then was all his studie bent to mortifie it, and make the flesh obedient to the spirit: the greatest austerities which for the moste parte are sharpe and most sensible to beginners, were his greatest contentment inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his companion nouices, were much excited by his deuotion, and the religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers much astonished for to see it.</p>
                     <p>Hee was committed to the charge of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same nation, a man of holy life, and greately conuersant in misticall Theologie, and in conducting of those which tooke the way of learning the crosse, to the end that hee might communicate more freely to him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee had in his soule, and that hee might

Therefore hee appeared to him visibly in diuers formes, sometimes in the forme of a religious man, &amp; some other times vnder the figure of some fearefull beast, as his malice and craft made him inuent: one while hee represented to him the manifold occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of suffering which occurred in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of Capucins, and that the time which hee might liue according to the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was too long to bee obliged to such suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, whereas after his profession, hee could not forsake that kinde of life, but he must bee euer reputed an Apostat.

                     <p>One tyme there was represented to him a rough stonnie way and full of thornes, which hee muste passe to enter into a pleasant gardē: the thornes affrighted him, but the beauty of the flowers of those borders, and the sweete odours which they sent forth was soe greate,

                     <p>These strange accidents made the Fathers feare least there might bee illusions of the deuill, and therefore to vnderstande them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they went to the true remedie, which was, that they prooued him by many &amp; greate mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, enioyned him extraordinary penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which hee did supporte with admirable modestie, patience and humilitie, searching in all occasions contempt of himselfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding IESVS Christe vpon the crosse, which are two foundatiōs vpon which Sainct Francis by diuine inspiration, established his wholle rule. Hee was almost continually in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases that it might bee truely said that his soule vnited to his body did liue in heauen among the Angells: I will not now speake of any other rapt, but that which befell him when hee was a Nouice, for the space of two dayes hee lay speecheles and without any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his senses, as farre as could bee seene, The fathers hauing neuer seene such strange rapts in any nouice, had recourse to the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, to knowe what they thought therof: the Phisitians which seldome haue recourse to God, when they can finde any reliefe in nature, ordayned that pigeons new killed shoulde bee applied to him, and that the bloud should distill vpon his head, but they gaue him noe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176965:192"/> ease in this; then they pricked his leggs and thighes with greate pinns, and for all this they could discorne noe motion or sense at all in him; This did so astonish the Fathers, that they thought to dismisse him, as soone as hee should begin to bee in a litle better stare. And they had indeed done it if the reuerend Father Hierome du Castferet, at that tyme Gardien of Paris, a man very famous for sanctifie and prudence, had not hindered it, who had beene generall twise, and thrice Procurator in the Court of Rome, and for the space of two and thirtie, yeares ordered very happily all the important buisines of religion: This reuerend Father well experienced in these cases, was allwaies of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that hee should not bee dismissed and yet to the end to try farther the soliditye of his spirit and his constancie to suffer patiently, all things for the loue of God, hee caused him to bee kept shutt vpp in a chamber for the space of fourtie daies, in which time hee could not goe forth, neither see nor speake to any man, but vpon sundaies and feasts when hee went to heare masse, and afterward hee returned to his cell, where hee beeing voluntarily kept for IESVS Christes sake, hee solaced himselfe with Christ in extraordinary spirituall rapts.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to our former discourse, after hee had beene out of himselfe for two daies, hee came in the end to himselfe, againe &amp; was soe possessed with ioie and iubilation, that hee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176965:193"/> seeking to conceale it with all humilitie, was yet forced to make outward shew of it; The Reuerend Father Bennett of Osimo Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall assembling some of the ancient Fathers together, sent for him to knowe in what state hee was, commanding him in the vertue of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, to conceale nothing from him, and to tell vnto him the naked truthe; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon presently hee beeing abashed and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his colour, entered into a discourse of two howres long, and treated of many points of perfection, which had beene reuealed to him, with soe high conceptions, that afterward they neuer made doubt but that his extasies were true, and not to bee suspected for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: His companious asked him if hee felt any thing of that which was done to him, hee said that hee felt it well, but that his spirit was soe occupied otherwise, that hee could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte it to speake or giue any signe of feeling.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding all this, to shutte the gate to vanitie which creepeth in vnsensibly like a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they did humble him by all sorte of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. They told him that hee was vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and altogether vnfitt for religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the spirit of Sainct Francis, and that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176965:193"/> declared the circumstances of his reuelation, and said that once as hee was vngirt, or rather had loosed the corde wherewith hee was girt, his spirit which was continually eleuated en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained it selfe in meditation vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the blessed Virgin, then did the Queene of Angells appeare vnto him very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and tooke his corde and girt him soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and assured him that hee shoulde perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere a childe of Sainct Francis exhorting him to continew his holy deuotions.</p>
                     <p>All the yeare of his Nouiceshipp was past in this manner, at the ende of which hee made humble sute to bee professed; And this fauour was accorded to him, whereof since God hath receaued the glory, his neighbour edification, and the wholle order honor and contentment.</p>

                     <p>Hee mounted yet farre higher by misticall Theologie, knowing that our flesh, was the more true crosse vpon the which God was nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led comming into this worlde, and where hee had endured, and daily doth endure, more cruell torments then the cruell Iewes inflicted on him; &amp; for this cause hee laboured to render crosse for crosse, passion for passion, dolour, for dolour flesh for flesh, causing his flesh to suffer

Therefore it is on this crosse of our flesh that hee hath endured and doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure dayly cruell paines; <note place="margin">☜</note> for when the Preist celebrateth only for gaine, it is then that hee is sould by his disciple: when the holy Sacrament is giuen to obstinate sinners, hee is deliuered into the hands of Iewes: when hee is receaued of an vnworthy soule, hee is traiterously kissed; when wee doe hinder him to doe his will, hee is bound and manicled: when after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, wee spend the tyme in prophane pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, hee is ledd shamefully thorough the streetes: hee is buffeted, by the hardenes of our hartes: hee is mocked, when wee pray to him and thinke of other things: hee is cladd as a foole, when wee despise to followe him; wee bende our knees in skorne, when wee kneele

                     <p>Moreouer, those who oppresse the poore, lay the crosse vpon his shoulders; those who terrifye them with threates, doe putt him into an agonye, they that take away the goods of the Churche, doe strippe our Sauiour of his cloathes; they who doe afflict Preists, doe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly scourge him; hee which deuiseth lyes against a religious person, accuseth him falsely, and staineth his good name, calleth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour drunkard and freind of publicans; those who accuse an innocent person, beare false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aginst IESVS Christe, and those which sweare prophanely, doe blaspheme him; the iudges which keepe a widowe or orphan long in suspence, doe tye him to a Pillar: and they which sēde them from one Court to an other, doe sende him from Caiphas to Pilat; the iudge which for feare of Princes or greate persons doeth not iustice, is an other Pilat, and hee which against his owne conscience, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

And to conclude briefely, they that committe any sinns, doe putt him cruelly to death crucifying againe in thēselues, the sonne of God, as Sainct Paul saith. This is the true crosse on which hee cryed <hi>I thirst</hi> (o man) for thy saluation, on which hee tasted the vineger and galle of our mallice, and on which hee had his harte and side pearced by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefullnes.</p>
                     <p>Soe did Father Bennet discouer the misticall crosse of our humanitie chastising in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his owne flesh, for to make it in some sorte like to that of his master. And whosoeuer will see some high conceptions vpon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let him see the booke which hee hath made entituled. <hi>The Christian Knight,</hi> and there doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly vnder the hierogliphie of a Souldier with his armes, and that which is needefull for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176965:196"/> warre, hee teacheth euery Christiā soule, which desireth to liue one day in Heauen with IESVS Christe, all things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in a spirituall warfare, and that which it ought to doe or auoid, the meane to subdue his passions, the art of rooting vp vices and planting vertues, and in one worde an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an actiue and contemplatiue life.</p>
                     <p>This extraordinary manner of meditating the passion in his owne proper flesh, in stead of contemplating him vpon mount Caluarie, imprinted in him more liuely touches, then it would haue done by other meanes: for it is certain, that these things doe more affect vs which touch our selues, then they doe when wee see them in an other; And as an habitude is gotten by actions, imprinting it selfe more strongly as the actions are violent, so this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Father did so bende the force of his spirit to God by the meditation of the crueltie of the passion, that three yeares before hee died, hee reposed not one houre and a halfe, of fowre and twentie when hee felt not himselfe drawen by diuine tracts with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176965:196"/> thereby. Hee suffered in his body, and for that which concerneth the inferiour powers of the soule, all that can be suffered, but the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part of reasō did take pleasure thereby, &amp; receaued greate contentment which was an infallible argument, that such attractions were truly from God and not illusions of sathan.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding that hee might not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by an act of profound humilitie, not trusting in his owne knowledg, nor in his own proper sense hee communicated this to one of the Fathers a man eminent in all sorte of scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both speculatiue, &amp; practicall, &amp; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preacher, coniuring him moste earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell him, whether hee were not beguiled in such actions both in regarde of the litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hee tooke in respect of the weakenes of his constitution, as in regarde of other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions because this diuine attraction did ceaze vpon him often before matins, sometime after, &amp; for the moste parte did houlde him all along the wholle day, though with lesse violence by reason of exteriour occupation and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>This Father knowing him familiarly for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares, and by humility iudging of the rest of his actions assured him that all was from God protesting afterward to the Fathers to whome hee made relation of this that hee had neuer heard so high things and so well deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as hee had done in this colloquie with

                        </gap>uours done vnto him, which hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to many others; But besides these, hee did suffer violent paines in all partes of his body in that for the space of twelue yeares after hee entered into religion, hee was so oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that there was noe sort of disease so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that could putt a man to more extreame paine then hee endured, with infinite patience, neuer complaining or murmuring, but allwaies praising God, and for all this hee did neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his daily mortifications. Hee did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent daily the communitie if hee could traine himselfe thither without falling, where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God one time to worke a miracle for his health, as I will relate heereafter. In fine, hee omitted noe actions of his rule nor of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deuotion, if the Phisitian did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him otherwise strictly for his health &amp; for his conscience.</p>
                     <p>The deuill not preuailing in his Nouiceship against him, to bring him againe into the world, ceased not to assaile him with other tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afterwards; For the fauours of God did serue him as a whetstone to sett an edge vpon his weapons: Hee laboured now to make him offend against his vowes, and for two yeares

                     <p>IF vexation doth giue vnderstanding as it is commonly said, then surely was Father Bennett endewed with greate vnderstanding, hauing suffered all his life such sortes of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which doe exceede humain frailtie to beare, if it were left only to naturall forces but as there are two sortes of knowledge to rayse vs to God, and to make vs despise earthly things; soe there are two principall wayes to attayne it: There is a knowledge of infirmity of nature, with the neede that we haue of the hand of God, which doeth supporte and keepe vs from falling, as a nurses hand doth hold the litle infant whome shee guideth, and this is caused by afflictions; For there is nothing which doth make vs returne so soone, as a snaile within his shell, as when God cometh to smite
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:176965:198"/> the hornes of our presumption &amp; arrogancie; The other knowledg is, that of the secrets of nature of politique and diuine lawes, of the misterie of our beliefe, all which scholasticall and misticall diuinitie doth teache vs both to assent to those matters of faith and also to knowe the relation and dependence there is betweene the creatour and creature, as also to discerne truthe from falshood, heresy from true doctrine, and to containe vs within the Church, and to reduce others which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: and this knowledge commeth not from afflictions but from trauaile ioined with a good temperature of the braine, or from those free graces which God bestoweth as hee seeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for our saluation, and for his glory.</p>
                     <p>How excellent Father Bennett was in the firste sorte of knowledge, it is already declared, and as yet in the chapters of his patience, and mildnes will appeare more. In the second which is more profitable towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hee did also excell: For nature had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with greate promptnes of witt, and he then confirmed it by his owne labour and diligence, that there was almost noe sort of art or science, wherein hee was not well conuersant; In his youth after hee had learned his humanities, hee gaue himselfe to the studie of the common lawe, wherein hee aduanced himselfe much for the time. After his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion when hee became a Capucin, hee was putt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:176965:198"/> to the studies of philosophy and theology, which hee learned with noe lesse facilitie, for the inward grace which sanctified his soule, cleared also his iudgment, to pearce into the most obscure difficulties. And will you knowe what was the booke which hee held conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in his hands, and turned often euery daye? It was the crosse and passion of our blessed Sauiour. The crucifix was his Repetitor or repeater, whose leesson hee did continually recite: And why did hee study so much this lesson? because hee would teach noe other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Those who conuersed with him knewe this well. And likewise the launcings of his harte in the pulpit accompanied with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and teares of his auditors, doe shew it sufficiently, and an infinite nomber of soules conuerted to God by his exhortations, who now beeing rauished with Mary Magdalen at the feete of the crosse, reeding this will witnes that I doe not speake the hundreth parte of that which hee merited in this kinde.</p>
                     <p>Besides these sciences hee was well seene in the learned tongues both Greeke &amp; Hebrewe in positiue diuinitie, and reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in controuersies and cases of conscience, so that it may bee said that hee had an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all sciences, there beeing noething worthy to bee knowen, which the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his witt made not very familiar vnto him: I neede not to proue it, for there is noe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176965:199"/> man whoe doth not knowe it and a greate number of Cardinalls, Archbishops, and Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, and other notable persons in the Church, who haue admired, cherished, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with theyr visites, and will testify this for a truth; as also for his greate trauaile and successe in gaining of soules after hee became a Preacher: The sublimitie of his doctrine hath beene knowen &amp; searcht after in the Cloisters of religions of all sortes, &amp; God only knoweth the number of religious men &amp; weomen who hauing beene conforted by his exhortations, and ayded by his doctrine, both by worde of mouth and writing, haue beene exalted to the high state of perfection, of whome some nowe enioying the recompence, doe knowe by effect what a happines it is for a soule, to haue noe other obiect in this worlde but the crosse: and others as yet not released from the thornes of this mortalitie, doe liue content and ioyfull in expectance and hope of the like crowne. And who is able to tell how many Princes, Noble men, Gentlemen, and others of all rankes qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and sortes, haue found by experience to their owne benefitt, how profitable it is to haue good councell for theyr consciences, against the comberances of the world, such as those were which this Father BENNETT had experimented? His outward carriage and comportement of himselfe, bred deuotion in others; For his very countenance and sweete
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:176965:199"/> behauiour, did teach others piety and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I should neuer make an end, if I woulde particularise all his actions, his manner of preaching full of fyrye zeale, the theologicall foundation which hee gaue to his morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes, his methode of sweetely winning sinners, his manner of treating with secular persones and what preparation he vsed for his preaching. Among other things, it is certayen that the fire of charitie was so kindled in him, that it made him often forsake his corporall refection, to giue spirituall; which hee did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise with such a supernaturall light &amp; so quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, that the streaming of it was sufficiēt to engraue his name in memorie amōgst posteritie.</p>
                     <p>One of the greatest losses which wee susteyne by his death, is the want of enioynig cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne workes which hee had begun, and left imperfect; in which there were greate matters expected touching perfection, since hee had already treated it so excellently in his <hi>Rule of the will of God,</hi> which booke is esteemed by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men (whoe are best able to iudg of it) one of the moste worthiest and fittest to guide a soule with assurance to the center of his last rest, and doth leade men on more easily with more loue then feare, and it cannot but bee such as I say whereas hee receaued the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and knowledge of it from heauen: For during his Nouiceship in one of his extasies wherein hee continued a long tyme as a man
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:176965:200"/> out of his body that is not seeming to haue any sense at all; God by a particular grace and light reuealed the subiect of it in one instant with so liuely apprehēsion of it, that some of his friends and Nouices beeing at that tyme with him to whome hee did communicate them at that present, did testifye that hee did then discourse more perfectly and more feelingly of this then hee hath done in his booke.</p>
                     <p>And I am well assured that the Doctors of Sorbon besides other greate eminent persones conuersant in misticall Theologie doe confesse that hee hath taken out the sapp of Cedar vpon the high mountayn of Liban which is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                     <p>One of his more particular designes wherein hee emploied himselfe with much feruour and affection was the conuersion of soules infected with heresie. For as wee hate more the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the fruit after we haue tasted thereof then if wee haue only the knowledge of it by the qualities, and wee labour more to roote vp the plants of this bitter fruite wheresoeuer wee find them: soe this blessed Father hauing beene formerly infected with heresy, and taken in deepely the venime of it, did more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly hate it, &amp; therefore did employe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test parte of that tyme which hee could spare from the excercise of his rule, in labouring to this end, not without greate proffitt and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt to straying soules; for the sweete temper of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176965:200"/> his cōuersation without euer entring into pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (though hee were prouoked) ioyned with greate prudence which knewe to make his right aduantage as occasion was offered, made him soe able to conferre with Heretiques, that by the one he wonne them to conference, and by the other hee seldome let them departe from him without beeing wholly conuerted, or at least troubled and perplexed in theyr owne doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Hee did often sette before his eyes the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full state of the most part of soules in his owne country. Hee detested that errour wherewith they were blinded, and had greate compassion of their misery, and out of charitie (which obligeth vs to loue our neighbour) hee wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theire conuersion from the bottome of his soule: vpon this occasion hee resolued to goe into his Countrey, and to labour in that holy haruest, of reducing wandering soules, &amp; preaching to them the kingdome of God by the way of penance, and noe labours (which are greate in these kindes) noe eminent perils of prisons or death, had any power to diuerte him from this holy purpose.</p>

                     <head>Of his going into England; and what happened to him during three yeares that hee was in prison. THE EIGHTENTH CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>THe loue which this good Father did beare to the crosse, did moue him to a greate desire of shedding his bloud for the quarrell of his maister wherefore hee chose rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne into his countrey, which being in the beginning of the heate of persecution in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland when racks and tortures were soe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that few or none could escape death by reason of the moste bloudy lawes enacted against Preists: Hee went from Paris in the moneth of Iuly, in the yeare, 1589. after hee had receaued the benediction of the moste Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Bishop of Modena, Legat of the sea Apostolique and Nuncio at that tyme of our holy Father Pope Clement the eight, and had the obedience of his superiour: hee had for his companion Father Iohn Chrisostome a scotish Priest and preacher, a very zealous and religious Father, whome the incommodities of prisons could not diuerte from returning since to his countrey for the reduction of soules.</p>
                     <p>The intention of this good Father Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was, to goe into Scotland for the cōuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of his father and moste of his kindred, which were all heretiques, and among the most
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:176965:201"/> obstinate, fowre of them beeing Ministers and Preachers. Departing from Paris they went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Haurede grace thinking to take ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, but missing of theyre hope, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking there, they went from hauen to hauen, till they came to Callis, where they found a shipp ready to depart, and soe went with many gentlemen Hollanders and other passengers, moste of them beeing Heretiques.</p>
                     <p>They had the winde fauourable enough to passe, but yet the passage was painfull to them; for on the one side, the Reuerend Father Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett was extreamely sea-sick, by reason of his tender and delicate constitution: on the other side hee was not a litle afflicted in minde for his companion, who was tormented with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feuer, which hee had contracted by his trauaile, and greate iourneyes which they had made: for besides that it was in the greate heats of sommer, the heauines of theyre habits did tyre them, forasmuch as they wore secular cloathes vpon theyre habits, which they had made of some light stuffe that by this disguise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt they might auoid dāger of beeing discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The morow after they were embarked, they landed betweene Sandwich and Douer, and going on theyr way straight towards Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they left theyr companye, telling them that for some occasions they could not take vp the same lodging with them, and soe staying a litle while, lett the others goe before.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:176965:202"/>
                     <p>How merueilous is God in all his workes, and how doth hee oftentimes dispose of our workes, when wee litle thinke of it! These good Fathers had greate contentment nowe in that they had quitted the companie of these heretiques, that they might the better order theire owne buisines: but God disposed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for the first howse which they came too, they thinking that it had beene an inne, was a prison; whoe can but wonder at this accident? This was doubtlesly Gods prouidence, which by a secret inspiration had incited his seruants to make choise of this vnpleasing and dolefull lodging, among all other places of the towne. to the end they might worke the conuersion of many prisoners lodged there for diuers causes, as they found it by theire experience afterwards effected.</p>
                     <p>Scarce were they entered, whiles Father Bennett was speaking to the hostesse for the reliefe of his companion, who was growne very weake by his feauer, but the Sergeants knowing them to bee strangers came to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to them from the Maior of the towne, the lawe which prohibiteth any stranger to take vp his lodging before hee giue an account to the Maior of what qualitie &amp; profession hee is; what a beginning is this I pray you? These good Fathers doe easily obey and presently followe the Sergeants, and came to the Maior, who began to interrogate them according to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:176965:202"/> vsuall manner; when any stranger is brought before him, and hee found presently what they were. For besides that they were found with their breuiaries (which gaue greate occasion to suspect them for Preists) theyr aspect full of reuerence, the sweetenes of theyr countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the grauitie of theyr behauiour, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie of theyr speeche, theyr patience in endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mocking &amp; railing words powred out of durtie mouthes against them, did bewray them: and many blasphemies belched forth against the puritie of theire religion, and against our holy Father the Pope, whome heretiques hold for Antichrist.</p>
                     <p>After this they were brought back by sentēce of the Maior, and attended by the same guarde of sergeants vnto theire first lodging, to wit to prison, to bee kept there vntill they expected the determination of the Queene of England and her priuie Counsell. They seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, thus shutte vpp, armed them selues with patience for the time to come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deale as effectually as they could for the conuersion of those heretiques which were in prison with them, there beeing at that time a greate number. This good Father beeing much occupied in seruing, and solacing his sick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, was much afflicted that hee had not more time and leasure to conferre with them, yet it pleased God so to blesse him in this holy worke, that in the space of eight daies which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176965:203"/> hee was there, hee conuerted some whoe did him much pleasure and seruice afterward, in many matters of consequence, when hee was prisoner at London and Wisbich.</p>
                     <p>After eight daies the Sergeantes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to bring them to a certeine Castle, where the Queene and the Court was, which was but two daies iourney distant from thence; It is needeles to tell in what manner they were treated in the way, and how they were putt in feare of death.</p>
                     <p>Beeing come to London they were first brought before the Lord Cobham, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued them very curteously, and entered into long discourse with Father Bennett, in somuch that hee seemed to bee not a litle mooued and troubled in minde there vpon. Hee tould him plainly his purpose, and likewise gaue him to vnderstand, that hee was a Capucin, and that hee had not abandoned his conuent for any other end but to come into those partes, to procure the saluation of soules which heresie had blinded, and that hee was ready to spende his bloud euen to the laste droppe in so good a cause; and if the persecutors should excercise all kinde of torments vpon his poore body, that hee was ready to suffer them, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tormēts nor death shoulde by Gods grace, haue the least power to alter his intention.</p>
                     <p>The holy Ghost wich spake by the mouth of this blessed Father, with such wordes full of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176965:203"/> zeale and sweetnes made them take roote in the harte of this Baron, wherevpon hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more earnestly on the face of Father Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett, considereth his comportement, &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth well all the circumstances of this small conference hee had with him; and it seemed hee was in conscience already well affected to the Catholique Religion.</p>
                     <p>They were sent afterward to the Queenes howse at Non such, where at that tyme the Queene was, and her Counsell, and for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond station they were presented to the chiefe Secretary of state, Sir Francis Walsingham, a man of greate credit and authoritie with the Queenes Maiestie, a man moste obstinate and stiffe in his false religion hee presently began to aske them what they were, and whence they came, and why they came into the countrey? now and then enterlacing some speeches of meere mocquery. Father Bennett made him briefe and pertinent answeres to all his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, with soe much grauitie and prudence, that all the companye which was there, had him in admiration for his discreete and modest fashion.</p>
                     <p>Among other things which the Secretary asked him, this was one, why they came two together, &amp; one in the companie of the other? To whome this good Father answered, that this was more conformable to the life of our Blessed Sauiour and his Apostles, and to putt in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:176965:204"/> practise his commandement to his Disciples, whom he sent <hi>binos &amp; binos,</hi> by two and two to preache the Ghospell. That this was likewise the practise of the primitiue Church, and the particular institution of their order, to the end that they might comforte one the other in the waie, and that one might partake with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ies of the other; oh, said the Secretary, it is rather that one may bee a witnes of the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and lewdnes of the other; wherevpon this good Father tooke occasion to make a speeche touching the difference and greate contrariety that there is betweene the children of God and the deuill, the children of light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, betweene the elected and reprooued, religious men and heretiques, concluding all with this sentence. <hi>Qui male agit odit lucem:</hi> Hee that doth ill hateth the light: Briefely the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his proceeding, and the freenes of his discourse, wonne so farre the affection of the Secretary, that although hee was one of the greatest enemies of Catholique Religion, and one of the greatest persecutors that euer was in England, yet did hee shewe fauour to them: for hee gaue chardge that all theire cost should bee defraied, from the time they were firste ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and commanded the Sergeants to restore them all those thinges which they had taken from them, which they did in parte.</p>
                     <p>The Queene which could not endure to heare of Preists, beeing aduertised of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:176965:204"/> of this blessed Father, of his prudence, and discreete behauiour, of his profound lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his strong defence of the religion hee professed, calming her passion in this kinde, was desirous to haue a sight of him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon she went to a windowe where she might see him as hee was to goe from her Court to bee carryed to the tower of Lōdon, according to the order of her Counsellors; In the way these fathers had leasure to confesse one to the other, not knowing whether they should haue the like heereafter, because they were to be putt a part by the sentence of the counsell, that so they might bee depriued of theyre mutuall consolation, &amp; the rather to shewe theyr hate to the constitutions of theyr religion.</p>
                     <p>The Capucins of the Prouince of Paris, beeing aduertised of the imprisonmēt of these two religious men made sute to his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian maiestie, that hee would interpose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for theyr deliuerance. For they sawe they could not bee deliuered by any other meanes: His maiestie condescended to the Capucins humble requeste heerein, who hating heresie, because hee knew well by experience the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sō of it, did beare a particular affection towards Capucins. His letters were deliuered to the Queene to obtayne this fauourable libertie for them; wherevpon Father Chrisostome beeing a Scotish man was inlarged: But Father Bēnett beeing an Englishman, and soe consequently a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:176965:205"/> vassal of the Queenes, was kept closse prisoner still, and soe farre was hee from obtayning li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that hee was now more afflicted, and by a new sentence, sent to the Castle of Wisbitch, which is a moste vnwholsome and vncōforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prison, by reason of the ill ayre of those partes, and the remotenes of the place from all that might yielde assistance and comforte, with a greate number of other Catholique prisoners both ecclesiasticall and secular persons.</p>
                     <p>Heere is worthie the obseruation, that the very first day that this Father was separated from his companion, hee putting away all feare, forsooke the secular habit hee wore, and openly made his habit appeare to the worlde, practising all the austerities of his rule, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, discipline, and other mortifications; whereby the Catholiques receaued very greate comforte and contentment, but the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques witnessing their hate and fury against it, did reuile him moste bitterly for it; Among others one whose name was Wright, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Dumnington, which came to dispute with him, thought hee shoulde putt him to greate shame for wearing his habit, vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king boldly to prooue, that hee was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to weare it, both by scripture and by the canons of the Churche: but hee failed of his proofe, and indeede hee bore away the shame of so bold and false an asseueration.</p>
                     <p>This Capucins habit vnknowen in those
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:176965:205"/> partes occasioned much derision and disdaine to Heretiques, and comforte to Catholiques, insomuch that Father Bennett passing by Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge (which is one of the famous Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the Realme, for the Colledges which are there built long since by Catholique foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Catholiques, though now vsurped by heretiques, as also the Churches with the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes contrary to the lawes of God and man and the intention of the founders) passing I say by this vniuersitie, hee was ledd thorough all their streetes as a strange monstrous spectacle: Hee was followed with odious shoutes and cryes, and all despitefull reproches they could possibly doe him. In the meane while this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Father, armed himselfe with extraordinary patience, and inwardly reioyced according to the example of the Apostles and Martirs, that hee was reputed worthy to suffer such contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies and outrages, for the name of IESVS Christe crucified.</p>
                     <p>When hee was come to Wisbitch and shut vp with other prisoners, hee began to excercise a fresh the rigours of his rule, and during eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene moneths which hee continewed there, hee brought forth greate and notable fruite, both for the consolation of Catholiques, and conuersion of Heretiques, who could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176965:206"/> many were desirous, to see him, some to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only theyre curiositie, and others to heare his discourse, and to knowe the growndes of his doctrine. Among these there were many Ministers of the protestants, who came thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to conuince him, but they departed from him with theyre owne shame; that which did inuite and drawe them more to conferre with him, was his etraordinary modestie, and sweete fashion of treating with them, which caused (according to the reporte of those that were fellow prisoners with him) that they chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conferre with him, then with any other Priest, because hee did forbeare to reprooue theyr impertinencies and absurdities, with soe much eagernes as many others would; neyther would hee euer bee transported by passion, though prouoked to it by the folly and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of others, knowing well that sweetenes and meekenes, often gayneth those, when ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour rather hardeneth; and that it is an vsuall thing for such obstinate and proud conceited men, to contradict more vehemently, when they see their aduersary in passion; our blessed sauiour was meekenes it selfe, and the firste les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sō which hee would his disciples should learne of him, was the practise of this vertue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them aboue all, to bee modest, and meeke as lambes among wolues.</p>
                     <p>This good Father wonne many soules in this manner, for there passed not day, that hee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176965:206"/> had not conference with one or other, &amp; often hee spent the wholle day in this good worke, soe that hee had scarcely tyme to say his office; other Preists wondered much at it, and seeing his soe greate trauayle, ioyned with his austerities, admonished him to spare himselfe, and tould him, that his weake body could not subsist with soe much labour, and so litle suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for (said they) Father you are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall action, alwayes in greate occupation of body and spirit, you take litle or noe rest to repayre your strength, this muste needes drawe on some infirmitie, to the ouerthrowe of your health; yea rather (said hee) I am better in health for this excercise, and was neuer more healthfull &amp; more able in body, thē I am at this present. And indeede it pleased God to blesse him heerein extraordinarily in witnes of his acceptance of such labours; for as I said before for twelue yeares after his entry among the Capucins, hee was soe weake, that there was allmoste noe disease whereof hee had not his parte, beeing oppressed without any intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with a greate weakenes of stomack, which infirmitie had now left him, soe that hee felt hardly any indisposition at all proceeding from his old malady.</p>
                     <p>Among other conferences which hee had with Ministers, there was one very remarkea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that hee had with the pretended Bishop of Ely, who was named Doctor Eaton, who had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176965:207"/> the fame among them to bee a very subtile disputer.</p>

Among the rest, was one knight called Sir Iohn Cuts; they earnestly solicited the Bishop to deale with him, and to conuict him of his errour; soe that the Bishop vndertooke it, and hauing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the time, they sent for him to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, without giuing him the least aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this theyr purpose. Hee supposing that it was to bee codemned to death for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, prepared himselfe rather to die, then to dispute; At the first, the Bishop began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate him as if his Inditement were now to bee made: but hee answered him plainly and categorically, not a whitt amased; but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a fewe questions, hee entered vnsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into a quest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:176965:207"/> him, to the dishonour and confusion of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop &amp; his adherēts: soe did this good Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise himselfe with greate commēdation in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Gods quarrell, and dayly working the conuersion of soules, till such tyme as after hee had beene kept three yeares in diuers prisons, &amp; was then sent back by bannishment into Fraunce (for soe he had his sentence) at the solicitation of his most Christian maiestie Henery the fourth of Fraunce: But that which occasioned the more speedy execution therof, was an other matter, which I will heere set downe.</p>
                     <p>A certaine vicar of the pretended Bishop of Norwich, named master Redman, accompanied with sixtie ministers, which came from a Sinode, came to Framingham Castle, where this father now was, being remoued frō that of Wisbidge, to confer and dispute with the priests, which were there prisoners, who were fortie in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; And to the end that all might be done with the more glorie, the gouernour of the prouince, who is the Lieutenant of the shire, was also there, called Sir Wingfield, who gaue coūtenance to this companie by his presence.</p>
                     <p>In the companie of these ministers, there was one called Wrigth, who hauing liued at Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, and there borne a great name, was greatlie esteemed for his learning and sufficiencie.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176965:208"/> others, did chaunge their colour, and were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their champian: and afterwards said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thēselues, that the faith of the Protestants, had receiued a great blow that day.</p>
                     <p>But this man being vain-glorious, was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this disgrace, but engaged him selfe for another day, to repaire his honor which he had lost. But to prouide for the worst, and to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the honor already lost, there were chosen three of the most able ministers, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for to encounter in a solemne disputation, three Priestes; vnder promise made by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, that they would obtaine warrant from the Councell, for the Priestes securitie in this action, which was otherwise a matter of great danger. Some weekes passed, during which time they treated of the points and circumstances of the disputation, whiles the consent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was procured. The Reuerend father Bennet was one of the three Priestes which were elected, for this disputation, as a man well qualified, both for learning and for pietie; But in the end, all came to nothing, for these Ministers becoming wise by the example of the former, after they had well thought vpon the busines, durst not appeare, nor yet could finde a more honest excuse, then to hasten the banishment of father Bennet and the other Priests: which being obtained speedily, they were quit and wholie discharged from this meeting.</p>

                     <head>Of his returne into France. THE XIX. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>AFter that Father Bennet had passed three yeares in prison, he was deliuered as afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. Whilst he was in prison, he made it a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre for the austeritie of his profession, and a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, preaching frequentlie there the word of God, and drawing many soules out of the sinke of heresie. The Catholiques were glad of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment, in regard of their desire that he might returne, to enioy the sweet contentments of his Cell, but otherwise they were exceeding sorrie to be depriued of his conuersation, his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and vertuous example.</p>
                     <p>His bretheren who knew how zealous and strict he was in the obseruance of his rule, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of life, &amp; great prudence and experience for the direction of soules, made him inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently master of the Nouices. This office he exercised a long time at Orleance and Rouen, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to euery one such an odour of his holines of life, and of his rare instructions, that many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent religious men, could not speake of him, without witnessing singular affection to honor his memorie, in recompence of those spirituall benefits which they thought they receiued from him, or by his meanes.</p>
                     <p>Among other precepts which he gaue to frame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176965:209"/> a life truly spirituall, that of abnegation was one, as the virtue which doth depriue vs of all that proceedeth from the world, or from our owne proper interest, to giue our soules entirely to God, for as much as he hateth harts that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, he seldome imparteth his graces to such, because the affection aymeth at some other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, then God alone: at the least wise, he neuer bestoweth his graces so abundantlie, as when we are void and quite emptie, of all other loue besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his. Therfore (said father Bennet) there are three sortes of abnegation, one temporall, another corporall, the third spirituall, which doe setle, confirme, and establish our soule, and all her good workes, as fastinges, disciplines, prayers, &amp; mortifications against al the assaults of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The temporall, is against the world, which by a couetous and disordered affection, to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges, seeketh to make vs strongly affected on her side to all vanitie, and so to become tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to her. The corporall, is against the flesh, which by fleshly pleasure, endeuoureth with might and maine, to depriue vs of the knowledg of the true and and soueraigne good, proposing to vs the false and masked, and couered ouer, with the outward appearance of the true. The spirituall is against the diuell, who by pride blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, and hindereth vs to reflect vpon our owne infirmitie, stirring vs vp to take the flight of ambition in soaring on high, to the end we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay full head-long into the the flames of hel fire.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:176965:209"/>
                     <p>The first of these abnegations, consisteth in the renouncing of gold, siluer, estates, dignities, enheritances, possessions, a trayne of seruants, and the like, and was recommended by our Sauiour him selfe, in the 14. of S. Luke. For want hereof, Achab, Giezi, Ananias, Iudas, and many others, ouerthrew themselues most miserablie. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond consisteth in renouncing the actions of all the senses, as seeing, hearing, speaking, tasting, smelling, touching, sleeping, cloathing our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and the like, which S. Paul doth recommend vnto vs, when he saith. Mortifie your members which are vpon earth. For want wherof, Dauid, Salomon, Herod, and infinit others offended God. The third abnegation extending farther then the others, doth depriue vs of all sort of complacencie, which we may take in our owne actions, of all vaine and curious thoughtes, and loue of our selues, and causeth vs to doe all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges only for the loue of God, seeketh his holy will in all thinges, and that which doth most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially tend to his greater glorie. By the first, we haue no more to doe with the world, nor the world with vs. By the second, our soule dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as yet in the earthly tabernacle of the body, doth lead a life like to Angels. And by the third, we are transformed into God, as far as may be, being in the state we are. The first, maketh vs children of heauen, because we doe despice the earth. The second, doth prepare for vs a white stole. to goe with the virgins, singing and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176965:210"/> after the Lambe. And the third maketh vs to tast here, the sweetnes of those liquours, which doe inebriate vs in blessednes.</p>
                     <p>This excellent lesson was put in practise by Father Bennet, before he taught it vnto others, which made him so much the more worthie of respect and honor. The contempt of all thinges, made him for to be indifferent, and to be all vnto all, so that by a wonderfull pleasing and shinning sweetnes of affabilitie, he gayned the harts of his very enimies, euen of his owne religious; So that since his returne from England, many heretiques tooke occasion, vpon scruple that they had of their religion, to confer with him, by which meanes, Gods holie spirit wrought by him insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, the conuersion of a great number.</p>
                     <p>It hapned one day, whilst he was Gardien at Rouen, in time of the extreamest heates of som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he not thinking of giuing any the least ease vnto his bodie, wore his habit pieced, in the selfe same maner as in winter. The bretheren seeing him worke in the garden, and to sweat such great drops as ouertooke one an other, had compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on him, and said. Father, you spoile your selfe, this heauie habit killeth you, giue vs leaue to take away these peeces which maketh it so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, they will serue you for another winter. What, said he, you mock me, my habit is as yours is, and I finde it light enough. Pardon me, said one of them, there is great difference, looke well vpon it, and you shall finde it to be so. They had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176965:210"/> for all this much adoe to perswade him. Loe what mortification this was, not to know in what maner his habit was, as whither it had such pieces vpon it, yea or no: certainly, this was the most extraordinarie grace of God, which held him alwayes rauisht, and by the attract of his loue, held him alwayes fastned to his Crosse, so that although he endured very much, yet he thought it to be nothing, for as much as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of his Lord and maister were more sensible to him, and kept downe the feeling, of all other exterior paines.</p>

                     <head>Of his virtues. THE XX. CHAP.</head>
                     <p>IT may seeme from the purpose to set downe so many excellent virtues wherwith this B. Father was adorned, into the narrow compasse of one chapter, but not purposing to make any ample discourse of them (which requireth a great volume to containe them) I will only point out some few actes of many excellent virtues, and by that scantling, giue the Reader occasion to see the true spring and fountaine, though it be not deduced into great streames. Who was there that knew him, that did not admire in him the greatnes of his charitie, the light of his faith, the firmnes of his hope? Who can speake sufficiently
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:176965:211"/> of the abillitie of his wit, his prudence, and his patience in all sorts of afflictions? His sweetnes of conuersation, his profound humilitie, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and prompt obedience, and of his simplicitie and modestie in all occasions? Who can worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie expresse, the austeritie of his pennance, the fruit of his silence, the effectes of his preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the violence or his labours, the crosses, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes, watchinges, fastinges, mortifications and his disciplines? The Reader him selfe may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily infer most of all these, out of our former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his B. life; Therfore I will only here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, some particular actions of eache virtu, which may moue to a true imitation of them.</p>
                     <p>And first concerning humilitie, which is as it were the foundation of all the other, no man euer conuersed with him, who will not say, that he was truly humble. The offices and charges, which his pietie and rare prudence made him to beare in his order, were not accepted of him, but when he could in no wise auoide them: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these places of superioritie, yet he neuer ommitted to stoope to those meane drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, which the lay bretheren are wont to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; In so much, that when he was Gardien at Rouen, if necessitie enforced him to goe into the towne, to doe busines of the couent, or for the comfort of his neighbour, he did ordinarilie carrie the wallet vpon his back, and begged from doore to doore, in going and coming: and to giue case to his companion, he alwayes would carrie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176965:211"/> the more heauie burthen, albeit he were very weake and feeble of nature. Thus he put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise what we said before of abnegation in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter, affirming often, that it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to haue the habituall virtu, if it were not accompanied with the actuall. We may (said he) consider abnegation in three maners; as first, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall and resident in our soule; secondly, as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for as much as it is ioyned, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a precedent act; in the third place, as actuall, for as much as it produceth truly, acts conformable to her being, which are, a despising of ones selfe, proceeding from the knowledge of our owne weaknes; The two first are good, but without the third, they languish by litle, and in the end doe drie and wither quite away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon great euills doe often follow, ether in the vnderstanding, by reason of a certaine darke cloud, which hindreth vs to know our selues, or in the will, which striueth not to get forth out of so dangerous a state. His humilitie was also seene, in hiding diligently those graces, which God did shew him in an aboundant measure. The more he did receiue, the more was he a true follower of S. Frauncis, esteeming him selfe, the most imperfect man in the whole world. No man could know his visions, but some very few of his most inward and secret friendes. One day, a brother seeing him stranglie transformed, and as it were vnited with God by contemplation, much more straightly then others were, he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176965:212"/> asked of him somwhat boldy, if he had not some extraordinarie vision in his extasie. What (said he) should I haue visions? They are not for such miserable sinners as I am; So much did he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cast downe him selfe, in the knowledg of him selfe, and in the nought of his owne weaknes, as God did raise him vp aboue others in grace and merit.</p>
                     <p>As for patience, which is the true sister of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, he professed it in so high a degree, that it seemed almost impossible, to attaine further in the exercise of this virtu. Affliction did neuer make him change color: and that which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much obserued in him, whilst he was in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, he had alwayes an extraordinarie force and magnanimitie of spirit, wherby he was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie fortified, in enduring of all torments, and garded by these virtues, against the violent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of what affliction soeuer. During the great rigours of his disease (which were most ordinary and daylie, as we haue before declared) albeit he was Gardien and superior, he was so obedient to the councell of those that were to councell him, that he neuer transgressed, yea he would obey his brother, or him that kept him, &amp; had a particular charge to serue him, so that often times he found him in the same posture, that he had put him &amp; left him the night before, without once stirring an arme. So God who is delighted in the sufferances of his friendes, and doth recompence them with increase of charitie, made him often taste the fruit
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176965:212"/> therof, by such actions altogether miraculous.</p>
                     <p>On a time, hauing had a violent and dangerous sicknes, for a long time, he began to complaine a litle of the rediousnes of the same: not out of any impatience in enduring the sicknes (for he did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish to be alwayes so exercised) but because he could not goe to the quire, &amp; performe other duties of the communitie. For this I will obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue by the way, that he was a great enimie of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie, and alwayes thought that most assured and true marke of sanctitie in a religious man to be, to see that it doth alwaies follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, without leauing it, vnles it be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame necessitie. And in this Pope Clement the eight had reason to say, that he would not haue a better argument to canonize a religious man, then to be assured that he had alwayes followed that which is ordained by his rule, for as much as singular actions &amp; particularities, are neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out selfe loue, which is one of the pestilences of religion. This blessed father therfore, disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his minde, that he could not follow the communitie, and resigning himselfe whollie into Gods handes, felt in his soule a certaine sweetnes, more then vsuall, and as it were a certaine voice which spake to the eare of his hart, assuring him that he should receiue a perfect remedie, on the day and feast of their Seraphicall father S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, so that he would follow the communitie. The effect shewed it afterward: for the eue of S. Francis being come, he issueth forth of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176965:213"/> infirmarie and goeth as well as he can to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectorie with others. They would haue giuē him some other meate, because on this day they fast with bread and water, telling him, that he was to weake and sick to fast, and that he would therby encrease his sicknes: but he forboare to eate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the rest did, following the inspiration or reuelation which he had had, and contented him selfe only with bread and water. The night following he went to Mattins, and he was no sooner vpon his knees, but lifting vp his hart to God to dispose him selfe to his office, he felt (which he imparted to some others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) a certaine inward cheerfulnes and iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of hart, which cannot be expressed, and he heard as it were a voice full of sweetnes, which conforted him, and said. <hi>Goe and singe confidently, for thou art now wholy cured of thy disease.</hi> O how good a thinge is it to endure for the loue of God!</p>
                     <p>Presently vpon this he recouered his health, and beginning to singe more loude then he was wont before he was sick, the other Religious knew right well, that God had shewed him some particular grace that night: and so recouering more and more, his former voice grew sweeter and stronger. Thus doth God repay the trauells which we endure, threefold beyond the valew of them, and maketh vs to see by infinit effects, that patience is one of the most necessarie virtues of this life. For indeed the patience was notable,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176965:213"/> that this B. father did practise with so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation; which he did compare to the arke of Noe, which preserued him and his familie from the vniuersall flood: his wordes are these. The Arke of Noe was caulked, to the end that the waters might not enter in: what is this Arke floating vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he deluge of mischiefes and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations? and what is this pitch wherwith it was caulked, but the fruit of patience, which keepeth the waters of afflictions, from entring into this Arke wel &amp; closely stopt, to extinguish charitie? and for this cause, such a soule saith. <hi>Aquae multae non potuerunt extinguere charitatem.</hi> Many waters could not quench charitie.</p>
                     <p>Let vs passe to other virrues, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting further in his feruour, nor in the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his rule, of which we haue already trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I will here recite a strange accident which hapned whilst he was gardien, and master of the nouices at Rouen. A certaine young gentleman was inspired of God to despice the world, and to become a Cappucin, who was so at lenght after many delayes and proofe of his constancie. His parents (as it falleth out commonly) being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for this his spirituall aduancement, and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this designe, attempted by letters, vsing therin the mediation of others, to draw him back. But when they saw they could not preuaile by this meanes, they deuised another, which they kept very secret, vnder pretext of going to visit him, and to be informed of his behauiour, and of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176965:214"/> his new course of life. And after they saw what contentment he found in a religious life, as he accompained them to the dore, they drew him by force out of the gates, and carried him away with them. The Porter hereupon began to crie, and the reuerend Father being aduertised of this lewed action, began to runne after as a good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard doth after a Woulfe, which hath taken away a Lambe out of his fould. But seeing his poursuing to be to no purpose, and that if he should ouertake them, he was not able to deliuer him forth of their handes; then full of feruour of spirit, and of a holy anger, he threatneth them with the iust iudgment of God, saying, that he would neuer leaue such an enormous crime as this, without some notable &amp; exemplar punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A thinge very strange &amp; worthy of marke, that at that very time, sentence was giuen from heauen, and was very shortly after put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to ratifie the true prediction of this good father. For some few monthes after, this younge gentleman, who could not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with any sortes of promises, came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to take the habit, and a litle after made his profession, who tould them, that from the very time that he was thus taken away, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began to grow sick, and impayring still in his health, dyed shortly after. This ought to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie those which seeke to draw their children by all meanes from religion: and although many are not so punished in this world, yet ought they to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:176965:214"/> assure them selues, that they shall pay for it in another, if they doe not satisfie for such haynous crimes, by great and extraordinarie pennances: and principally, if such children come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and lewed, and leese their soules by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of worldly encombrances in the way of virtu which leadeth to heauen. For if Religious men haue labour enough and much dlfficultie to saue their soules, why should not secular men feare, who haue soules of the same mould as they haue? I will add another storie, for proofe of this which hapned at the same time, and in the same place.</p>
                     <p>A certaine preacher Capucin, borne of one of the best and noblest families of Normandie, bore a singular respect to the piety of father Bennet, and he likewise, did singularly affect him. One day as they conuersed together, and discoursed of death, and of the state of soules, separated from the masse of corruptible flesh, they made a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pact one to the other, that which should die first, should aduise the suruiuer of his estate, if God of his grace and mercie would permit it. This preacher died first, and two or three dayes after his buriall, as this good father was in praier in the quire before matins, where he passed the most part of the nighte, he appeared vnto him in that forme and fashion, which witnessed a great affliction. After matins he came againe, and euery time he spake only these wordes. <hi>Multorum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, grande leuatur onus:</hi> that is to say, a great
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176965:215"/> burthen is lightned by many mens handes, and sodainly he vanished.</p>
                     <p>This good father, iudging of his state by his wordes, could not forbeare to shed teares, and redoubled the feruour of his prayers, and for three dayes space, he caused all the Priests to celebrat Masse for him, and others to communicate after his intention: which done this soule appeared no more: giuing him therby to vnderstand, that his paines were changed into eternall rest in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. This was the entertaynment of this blessed father, who occupied him selfe wholy in prayer and contemplation, by which he was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnited to God his only obiect, and the virtu of pouertie, did dispose him the more vnto it, which he fostered as his mother. For to pray well, it is expedient to thinke of nothing but of God, and this thought can not be entire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, vnles our harts be voide and emptied, from the affection of all earthly thinges. To this end he said right well, that there were three sortes of pouertie, necessarie for three sortes of prayers, vocall, meditation, and contemplation. The first is, a pouertie of affection proper to all Christians, which consisteth in nor adhering to earthly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but following the councell of S. Paul, to vse them in possessing them, as if we had them not: and those which are endued with this spirit, say easilie to their thoughts when they enter into the church; Attend me at the gate, as S. Bernard did. The second is, the pouertie of prosession,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176965:215"/> which belongeth only to religious men, who by their vowe, doe depriue them selues of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and this being more high then the other, doth greatly solace a soule, and maketh it more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of meditation, lifting it vp so much the more in this state, as it hath lesse proprietie or demai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ether in common, or in priuat.</p>
                     <p>The third sort of pouertie is yet more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then these two, which is a pouertie of spirit, not as it is ordinarily taken, for that which depriueth vs of all inordinat affection to riches, but for as much it ordereth our affections tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching spirituall and heauenly thinges, causing that the soule doth not desire them for it selfe, nor for her particular profit, but only for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, to whom it hath giuen the hart, the thoughts, and all affections. And this stripping the soule perfectlie of all corporall and spirituall thinges, of all desires which tend to her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar interest, is disposed by this maner to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and by continuall actions of loue and charitie, kindleth it selfe, yea and consumeth it selfe, to transforme it selfe, and become vnited vnto God, which is the vtmost degree of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life.</p>
                     <p>Now it is easie to iudge, how this father was poore in these three kindes of pouerties. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession doth sufficiently proue the two first, and his soule fastned to the Crosse, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission tasting the fruites wherof, he hath left vs the feede in his booke <hi>of the will of God,</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrat
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176965:216"/> the third. And from this vnion, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth charitie, yea perfect charirie cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this vnion, and hence sprunge the peace and tranquillitie of all his desires within him selfe, a constant concord with his neighbour, wisdome which is the first gift of the holie Ghost, which doth penetrat the misteries of God, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat mercie to confort his neighbour in his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, promptnes to Gods seruice, the practise of good workes, and the soule, the life, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l virtues. So that to speake that briefly, which I cannot particularize in a whole volume, this blessed father being vnited to God, we may truly inferre and conclude, that passions did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trouble the peace, which he did inwardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: that the saluation of his neighbour, was as tender to him, as his owne: that he thought no time so well spent, as when he could cooperat therto in any maner: that his wisdome did sound the most secret misteries: that his good workes were inestimable and great, his affections great, his virtues great, and therfore his memorie and his name, ought to be great among men.</p>
                     <p>Besides these virtues, which made him so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God, and his admirable actions in the eyes of the world, he had certaine o her graces or gifts which S. Paul reciteth as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular benefits of the holy Ghost, to those to whom they are imparted. There was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to spirituall beautie, wherof he had not some part and portion, and by his pietie and zeale
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176965:216"/> which he boare to Gods seruice, he often times did many thinges, which may very well be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med miraculous.</p>
                     <p>Being once sent to Audely there to remaine, it hapned as he came into the chappell, which is in the entrie to the church, he espied that there was no picture vpon the Altar, wherat he was much moued: for let heretiques say what they please out of their foolish malice: images are not only bookes of ignorant persons, but of more perfect men, who finde motiues in them to deuotion, which they would not haue otherwise. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he asked father Gardien, what the cause was, that their chappell was no better adorned? He answered him. Father we are so poore in this place, that we know not how to beautifie it, or come by those conuenient ornaments. Hereupon he willed him to prouide some colours, with which although he knew not what belonged to painting, nor euer in his life had handled pensill, he made an image of our B. Lady, in which are represented all the simboles and Hierogliphes, which be required to exalt the virtues of the queene of heauen, and ho so laid and disposed the colours, that for the beautie therof, and for the deuotion which it doth excite in the harts of those that doe behould it, it was changed and put in the place of that image of the high Altar, where it yet remaineth to this present.</p>

                     <head>Of his extasies and rapts, and of the graces which he receiued in them. THE XXI CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>IF I shall speake as it is meete of Father Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and of his straight vnion with almightie God, of the force, of the perfection, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation therof, I should not say, that he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies or rauishments, but that his whole life from three and twentie yeares of age that he became a Cappucin, was a continuall rapt and perpetuall extasie. When soeuer he was seene, or where soeuer he was, he had his spirit alwaies lifted vp to God, the sight of the base creature, made him to become engulphed in the knowledg of his Creator. This was much noted in him, that when any man spake vnto him, and asked him any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he must repeate the same thinge twice vnto him, because his soule being otherwise preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, did not heare the first time: so that many had not bene edified by his conuersation, had they not knowen his great pietie; for oftentimes he spake so short and so brokenly, as if he had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted words to expresse what he would say.</p>
                     <p>His extasies were iudged for such, by those that being very conuersant in mysticall Diuinitie, found them to be truly supernaturall; for they could not be soundinges as some might imagin, for as much as a soundinge, according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176965:217"/> of Galen, the prince of Philosophers, is an interception of the sence, by an obstruction of the sinnewes, which taketh away the pulse from the artyres, and doth wholy depriue vs of the vse of reason. But so far was this Father from being depriued of knowledg, and of the function of the spirit with that of the sence, that on the contrary part, he was lifted vp to God, and receaued great illuminations touching the illuminatiue life, and assured way of perfection. Soundinges are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and doe follow a sodaine failling of all the forces of the body, which carrie away with them those of the spirit, but extasies are from God, which by a drawing of loue, attracteth soules to him, to make them tast those sweetnesses, which they could not otherwise.</p>
                     <p>When Father Bennet therfore, recited those thinges of so high a nature, after these extasies, wherof he now had knowledge before, who can presume to say that this was naturall, and that they were nothing else but soundinges? For they arise from a great emptines or priuation of vitall spirits, which cannot passe to the place, ordained by nature for the functions. But extasies on the contrary part, proceed from a repleation or aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace, which maketh the soule conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in heauen, being yet fastned to this masse of earth. So S. Peter in the 10. of the Acts, falling into an extasie of spirit, saw a great sheete which came downe from heauen, full of all sortes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane creatures, with a voice which said vnto
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176965:218"/> him; <hi>Kill, and eate.</hi> So S. Paul reporteth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he was rapt euen to the third heauen, and there saw thinges, which the sense cannot comprehend. And S. Iohn in the Apocalips, was first rapt in spirit on the Lords day, and saw so many maruellous thinges which he reciteth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the circumstances▪ of the generall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So this holy Father being rauished in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and receiuing the knowledge of that which he could not attaine by great labour and painfull studie of manie yeares, we cannot but iudge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, that these were graces which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God, in the sweetnes of his extasies.</p>
                     <p>Whilst he was Gardien at Charters, he fell into a grieuous sicknes, which most men thought would haue bene his last: for the violence of the feuer was so great, that it could not be asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by anie remedie: and he being but lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered of other former diseases, besides his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities, he was become so weake and leane, that he was nothing else but skin and boane, so that it was thought almost impossible, that he could resist this brunt. In this case, he caused an Image of our blessed Lady to be brought vnto him, being singularly deuout vnto her, and caused it to be set at his beds feete, that so he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behould it. But he was no sooner entred into contemplation, but that he fell into an extasie, for the space of eighteene houres, all which time, his sences were depriued of their functions, and during this while, he had no maner of feeling of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176965:218"/> his disease; Yea some did cry in his eare, but he did not heare them. His colour for this time, was far more vermillian and cheerful then before, being more ruddie, where before it was more pale and wanne. To conclude, he was in such a state, that both the phisitians, and some others who came to see him said, that there was nothing but his bodie there, and that his soule was vnited to God in such a maner, that they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse nor well conceiue. This then being said, is a great argument of his sanctitie, which they had formerly beleeued, but that hereafter there was no cause to make the least dout therof. Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene houres after he came to him selfe, seeming to be wakened out of a profound sleepe, and presently very cheerfull and well disposed, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him selfe vpon his bed, as if he neuer had been sick: God did that in a moment, which the phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians could not doe in a longe time: and who will now be so hardie, as to affirme, that this was rather a sounding, then an extasie?</p>
                     <p>An other time, the zeale of the glorie of God and saluation of soules, particularly of those which were infected with heresie, drew him forth into a village nere Orleance, where there were many Hugonots. In all his sermons, his first disposition to enter into so holie a worke, was feruent praier, that he might lighten their darke vnderstandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and mollifie their obstinat and peruerse wils. But at this time he was very long, and very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in his praier before he went to preach, so
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:176965:219"/> that his companion, turning his eye towards him, saw him compassed about with a light, and lifted vp more then two foote from the ground, absorpt in contemplation of the diuinitie, which is the fountaine of all learning and of all virtu, from whom doutlesly he drew all that which he was afterwards to speake, to conduct and guide the poore abused soules to God. So that it may be more rightly said of him, which S. Thomas said of S. Bonauenture. <hi>Let vs suffer</hi> (saith he) <hi>one Saint to trauell for another:</hi> for as much as he did labour but for one, which had bene formerly a sinner; but Father Bennet did labour for Iesus Christ God and man also, the fountaine of all holines, and the springe of our glorie. He was seene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other times in extasies, whiles staying in the quire after others, he was intentiue vnto prayer. But I haue reported this action more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, because it was accompanied with the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of many, who afterwards became deuout and feruent Catholiques, bearing so much the more true and earnest affection to Gods church, as they bore hate and malice to it before.</p>

                     <head>Of his last sicknes and his death. THE XXII CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>IN the yeare of our Lord one thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eleuen, died this blessed father Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, in the couent of the Capucins of our B. Lady,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:176965:219"/> being at this time, the ordinarie Confessar of the religious women of S. Clare, surnamed the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Passion, of whom we haue spoken in the life of the B. Father Angell of Ioyeuse, in the chapter of his transporting to Paris. The graces which God did him during his life, were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in this last passage of his death. His sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was nothing in a maner, but a continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, in which he being vnited to God, receiued great contentment in his soule, and in the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part therof, among the exceeding great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of his body, and the part inferior. His affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alwaies resigned into the handes of God, kept his will so occupied in the contemplation of the glorie which he was shortlie to enioy, that by reason of a perfect contempt which he had of all earthly consolations, he would hardly be wonne to speake any thinge, desiring rather to speake with Angells, in the inward closet of his hart, then outwardly with men. Wherupon it came to passe, that God by a particular grace, which he doth not giue but to the greatest Saints, reuealed to him, the time, the day, and houre of his death, to the end he might dispose him selfe with the more feruor for the same, and might omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which might be most necessarie for him in this last passage, whither interior for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and compunction, or exterior for Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and prayers. For one of their fathers, an eminent man in this holy Religion, visiting him the day after he was sick in bed, and coming to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176965:220"/> take his leaue of him, because he was going to preach in the prouince of Tourain, asked of him, if this should be his last sicknes, for the separatiō of soule &amp; body, in yeelding the one vp to God, and the other to the earth? This B. father, lifting vp his eyes to heauen and sending forth a groane to God, said, Yea without all dout, and this also was at that very time, when discoursing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he tould him thinges which can not be learned, but within the practise of a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes he was heard to speake within him selfe, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h a spirit wholy abstract and retired, but with so soft and low a voice, and without any perfect distinct sound of wordes, that no man could vnderstand what he spake. In these secret colloquies a man might see, as it were a certaine light to streame from his face, and I know not what kinde of serenitie, which droue others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiration of him who visited him. O if they could but haue heard and comprehended, those discourses which his soule had with God priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if they could haue seene the thinges which he saw, and haue bene made partakers of those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries which were reuealed to him, how would they haue bene astonished? For if the outward shew was so powerfull, how forcible had the truth it selfe bene? But as soone as this Father tooke notice, that somthing was obserued in him, which might bewray his inward perfection, he retired his spirit as much as he could from this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176965:220"/> contemplation, to the knowledge of his owne infirmitie: or else informed himselfe of somwhat that was imperfect in himselfe. Which when a brother of his perceiued, who had knowen him a long time, he began to aske him, if he had not some reuelation of his future estate, or of his life past? To whom he presently returned answere. What doe you speake to me of Reuelations, who am the most miserable wretch vnder the cope of heauen? and thus shewed, how much he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with such a question, which tended to his owne praise and commendation. During his life, he was singularly affected to speake of God, and of thinges which helpe a soule to the path way of heauen, but in this last sicknes, this desire had gayned great increase, in so much that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous to haue a Religious man still about him, endued with the same spirit: for if any man would seeme to say, that he should by Gods grace escape this sicknes, he presently shewed, that such speeches were disgustfull to him.</p>
                     <p>He had a Crucifix at his beds feete, on which he continually fixed his eyes, and by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie feeling of our Sauiours doulours, wherof he was desirous to be partaker (as we haue noted before) he gaue free passage vnto teares, notable to hould them any longer, by reason of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of his loue: and kissing the Crosse which he had in his hand, he sent forth many groanes, shut his eyes, and adored God in his soule, whom this figure did represent vnto him, from whom
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:176965:221"/> he knew that saluation &amp; all glorie that he could hope for, had their springe &amp; their begining. His disease was violent, and his strength declining by litle and litle, made men to knowe, that the end of his pilgrimage was at hand.</p>
                     <p>The night before his death, a good Religious man, who had a great care to serue him, and not to forsake him, seeing him very quiet in spirit, and of a cheerfull countenance, as though he had felt no kinde of griefe, asked him, if now he would speake nothing, drawing so nere to his end, for the confort of his bretheren, of whom he had so great care during his life? He made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him this answere, of an affection full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and a great abasing of him selfe. Alas, miserable sinner that I am, what edification can I giue, and what good thinge can the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren hope for of me, who am the greatest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the world? And presently ioyning his handes, and lifting vp his eyes and hart to God, he added this versicle of the prophet Dauid. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sum ego, &amp; in laboribus à iuuentute mea.</hi> I am poore, and haue liued in labours from my youth.</p>
                     <p>The day being come wherin he was to rendar vp his soule to God, he would like a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian warriar, and singularly of the company of S. Francis, arme himselfe with compleate armour for this encounter. The most holie Sacrament was brought vnto him, and presently after, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction was ministred to him, and all the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176965:221"/> bretheren being assembled, could not possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine to weepe, not only for the losse of so holy and so zealous a man of their Religion, but seeing the effects of his profound humilitie, accusing him selfe before them all as an vngrateful man, saying, that he had neuer giuen them good example, and demaunded pardon of them, with such contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as can not be conceiued nor expressed.</p>
                     <p>A litle while after he had receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and giuen thankes vnto God for so great a benefit, he asked them saying. Is not this the day of the Presentation of our B. Lady? And when it was tould him that it was, he began to cry out with a loud voice. <hi>O virgin which:</hi> and presently stopt, finishing the rest with inward wordes full of affection, which is more proper and more common to holie men, then the vocall and exterior.</p>
                     <p>One of the fathers who spake to him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirituall matters, as they are accustomed to doe in such cases, demanded of him, if he were not content and glad in his foule, that he was so nere to his deliuerance out of the miserie of this life, &amp; now ready to arriue in heauen, there to liue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, not a dying life as this which we leade, but a quickning life, full of glorie and felicitie, where he should see their Seraphicall Father S. Francis, and the soule of the B. Father Angell, where he should conuerse with them, and singe with them foreuer, cāticles of praises vnto God, beholding no more in a glasse, &amp; thorough the shadow of faith only,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:176965:222"/> but face to face in an Angelical maner? He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only this; <hi>That is it wheron I now doe meditate.</hi> He was asked likewise, if he would not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes againe, seeing there is no man so iust, who doth not often fall. To which he replyed with the wordes of the Apostle: <hi>I am guiltie to my selfe of nothing, but yet in this I am not iustified.</hi> By his short answers he made it appeare, that he had his spirit well occupied, wherfore he was left awhile vnto him selfe, in his meditation, hauing his eyes alwayes behoulding and fastned vpon the holy Crucifix, which was standing at his beds feete.</p>
                     <p>About halfe an houre after, he desired them to call for father Gardien, <hi>for</hi> (quoth he) <hi>it is now time.</hi> This good Father sick of a violent feuer, felt inwardly the greater griefe, that he could not asist this blessed Father at his departure, then he did by the extremitie of his disease. For besides that they were both of the same contrie, and had borne one to the other a very particular and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent affection, from the time that they first met in Flanders, hauing forsaken their parents and frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and had both of them the same designe, and at the same time had both taken the habit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and receiued great consolation by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conuersation; notwithstanding, hearing that he desired to see him, he went from his chamber, not without much paine being very sick, and they entertayned one the other, in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and good discourses. The violence of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gardiens feuer would not suffer him to stay
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:176965:222"/> any longer, so that he was forced to retyre him selfe, and to take his last farwell of him, with his benediction, which he gaue him not without many teares.</p>
                     <p>His Gardien being gone, he turned him selfe towards the Religious who were present, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought them to pray feruently for him; <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould</hi> (saith he) and presently stopt. And as one of the Fathers was about to say, that they were not worthy to pray for him, but that they were in good hope that he would pray for them. Ah, said he, recite some prayers to the honor of the B. virgin and of S. Michael, for as much as there is no spirit so strong, but that it may faint. This made them coniecture that he saw somthing, and that the diuell, who during his life, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigle him, did now attempt for to wound him. Wherfore, some of the Religious praying, and one of them reading, he had not read a dosen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but the blessed Father said. <hi>It sufficeth:</hi> which made them presently beleeue that the tentation was past, and the enimie vanquished; For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he lay very quiet, and seemed to be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundlye occupied in contemplation, as if he had bene in one of his extasies, which he had in his best strength. O how ought the wicked to feare death, when such virtuous men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted in such maner! would to God they would reflect seriously hereon, once at the least in all their liues.</p>
                     <p>The time drawing on that he was to depart, he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176965:223"/> turned his eyes vpon those that did asist him, and asked them what it was a clock? And it being answered him, that it was fiue a clock, then said he, say no more to me now, but <hi>Iesus Maria, now pray yee all for me.</hi> Whosoeuer had seene at that time the poore Capucins (but rich in heauenly graces) on their knees, their armes spread in forme of a Crosse, their eyes lifted vp to heauen, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their cheekes with teares, now redoubling the feruour of their prayers, and prouoking the Quires of Angells, and all the the B. Saintes, to come and receiue this blessed soule, he would doutlesly haue said, that one moment in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of religion, bringeth more true contentment to a soule, then an hundred yeares in the faire open fieldes of this miserable world, and to see so many deuout soules to pray for a holy soule, who whilst the Priest did pronounce without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, those holy and sacred names of <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Marie,</hi> augmenting the fire of his charitie, and not able to suppres it any longer, brake out into these wordes with a strange violence. O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, o incomprehensible abisle of the loue of God!</p>
                     <p>This said, instantly his spirit fayled him all at once, and lifting vp his eyes to heauen, he entered as it were into a rauishment, where his soule fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding true contentment, &amp; the centre of her sweet rest, departed so sweetly, that he seemed rather to sleepe then to dye; and so it was a sweet sleepe of peace in the vision of his God, a sleepe of glorie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176965:223"/> and fruition of his Creator: yea such a sleepe it was, that euerie Catholique Christian may desire and say, that which Balaam constrained by the spirit of God, said. <hi>Moriatur anima meae, morte iustorum.</hi> Let my soule dye, the death of the iust. So be it.</p>

And certainly we reade both in ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne histories, that many haue beene called from east &amp; west to the kingdome of God, if we looke backe vpon all the diuers ages of the world, from the time of our blessed Sauiours incarnation euen

                     <head>F. Archangels countrie, and his mothers kindred. THE I. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>THe kingdome of Scotland, ancient and well knowne, hath brought forth some notable persons both men and women for pietie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of life, descended of blood royall, who in diuers ages haue come thence by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence into the prouinces of Belgium, and as is euident by true stories, by voluntarie pilgrimage haue entred into those parts, that they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue the people with good manners and holesome instructions, and bring them to the light of faith from the darkenesse of infidelitie, or might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them declining by litle and litle from the light, hauing once shined vpon them, to behold the amiable beames thereof againe, and confirme them in the happie enioying of this benefit. And albeit this light seeme to be withdrawen from the kingdome of Scotland, being infected with diuers heresies by the seueritie of Gods iustice, yet is it not soe wholy taken from them, but that it often breaketh out through the thicke clouds of errours, and sendeth forth beames which cause a spirituall fruictfulnesse; so that here and there manie good graines of wheate growe vp among much cockle, and make a litle haruest not to be neglected. For as much, as it is lesse in quantitie, it is more preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176965:227"/> But if the rest of the graine by reason of the thicke growth of tares, seemeth to be somwhat, or for the most part choaked as that it cannot growe vpp, we knowe that our most gracious God liueth, able to raise of stones children of Abraham, who will cause at a fitt season, the seed of faith which seemeth there to be as it were dead, to sprout sorth and to be plentifully mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.</p>
                     <p>Herein I will not heape vp manie examples, I will only recite one or two fitting this purpose. How choice and good a graine was the most vertuous queene Marie of Scotland, mother of Iames the sixt, the most potent king of greate Britannie; How fruictfull a graine was she euen to death, by whose example manie being prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and among others some most noble persons neare vnto her in the same royall stemme, I meane the two brethrem named Gordons, who at seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times yeelded vp their liues to death for the glorie of God. And that noble personnage and verie reuerend Father, Iames Gordon Huntley vnkle of F. Archangel, a true and elect Priest of God, verie lately deceased after much miserie which he endured in Scotland for the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull, refufed peremptorilye the Marquiship, descending to him by the death of his elder brethren, though offered to him by the politique state-smen, choosing rather to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in the house of God, and in the most holie Societie of Iesus in which he liued and died, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176965:227"/> vnder the yoake of obedience to passe a long and voluntarie martyrdome in banishment, then to haue that contentment and estate of temporall greatenesse and felicitie.</p>
                     <p>O happie stocke, out of which so manie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble branches of sanctitie haue sprung! among which this F. Archangel &amp; his mother, the sister of so noble brethren, are not in the last ranke. For why should the sister not be partaker of the holy lott fallen to her brethren? Was not that diuine fauour also done to her, that she might suffer also somewhat for Christ, to the open viewe of the world? In the continuation of this discourse you shall see, a vertue and power of God eminently shewing it selfe in this fraile and weake sexe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue beheld the birth and stock of her sonne, Iohn Forbese, predestinated from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be the seruant of God, whose storie we nowe treate of, and whose life we doe begin by Gods assistance to make knowne; By occasion whereof, we shall see manie casualties of the sonne and mother, and what she suffered with her sonne, and he with his mother.</p>

                     <p>SHe being the sister of the forenamed brethrē, who died for the defence of the Catholique faith, from her tender age inwardly couering to be wedded to her heauenly spouse, was greatly inflamed with the loue of virginitie, and when she was mariageable, did earnestly seeke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate her selfe to God in some religious order, if not in her owne countrie, at the least in an other foraine countrie. Which desire when she one day reuealed to her mother, she receiued a blowe on the side of the cheeke, with an angrie repulse in this manner, I haue (said her mother) but two daughters, if one chance to die and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Nunne, what will become of all my is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue? whereas my sonnes haue voluntarilie lost their liues.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176965:228"/> noble Damoiselle was maried to the Count or Baron of Forbese, who was rich and mightie in possessions and domaines, though inferiour in nobilitie. In such manner was S. Elizabeth the daughter of the king of Hungarie, wedded to the Landgraue of Turingia, though she desired to match her selfe only to the heauenly bridegrome.</p>
                     <p>Margarite was maried to Forbese for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of some enmities betweene the two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. After some fewe yeares, Forbese had by this most noble matrone, besides the eldest sonne and some daughters, this second sonne Iohn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bese, who afterward changing his name, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner in his first entrance into the order of the Cappucins, was called Brother Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changell. I may trulie style her most noble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is of the royall blood of the Stuarts, of whose nearer ancetours a noble persō wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in that nation, maried the daughter of the king of Scotland. Archangels Father was descended from a noble familie of the Forbes in Scotland, verie rich in earthly substance, but which is to be lamented, verie poore in soule, as beeing an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate heretique. His mother from her infancie was alwaies a Catholique, by name Margarete Gordon, the daughter of the Marquis of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who after the taking of the king of Scotland, gouerned the kingdom as a Prince next in bloud, and as a good Catholique, faithfully assisted the Queene then regent beeing left a widowe, who afterward was a glorious martyr. While he liued
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176965:229"/> the kingdome continued in the Catholique faith, but as soone as he was taken and beheaded through the faction of the bastard of the king, it fell into heresie.</p>

For some yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res beeing nowe past, that she had suffered manie wrongs and indignities of her husband, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally because she was constant in her faith, she was put away by him, and when he sawe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uariable for her beleife, he tooke an other of his owne sect, not vnlike to himselfe in manners. She being thus diuorced, was driuen to seeke harbour among her kindred, liuing verie secretely. It was the more grieuous, because at this time she bore in her wombe this most worthy fruict and deare infan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Iohn Forbese. Giue me leaue to insist a while in recoūting the miseries which this noble dame Margarete bore, being great with this child, both in her owne person and his, the rather to encourage Catholiques in their miseries by this example: as also to shewe them the vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie successe of mariage, betweene those who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in religion. It was well said of the Poet. <hi>Si vis aptè nubere, nube pari.</hi> If thou wilt marie wel, take an equal mate. Which precept the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians thought fit to keepe so exactly, that Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch reporteth of Archidamus king of Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, who because he tooke a wife of a smaller stature then himselfe, he was deepely fined of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176965:229"/> them, who pretended this cause, that Archida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus by his vnequal match, would beget to them not kings but Kinglings, which is to say contēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible for their litlenesse. How then are they to be fined and punished, who neglecting religion, and respecting only riches and nobilitie, doe match their sonnes and daughters with heretiques? Who can be more vnequal, and more vnlike one to an other, then those who professe a contrarie religion? Howe then are these mariages made by the parents as the authours and promotours? If the wolfe shall communicate at anie time with the lambe, so the sinner with the iust. Saint Paul saith; Beare not ye the yoake with infidels. For what participation hath iustice with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? or what societie is there, betweene light and darkenesse, and what agreement with Christ &amp; Belial, or what part hath the faithfull, with the infidel, and what agreement hath the temple of God with the Idols? For you are the temple of the liuing God, as God saith. I will dwell and walke in them, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. But if anie one shall violate the temple of God, God will destroy him. Iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie saith the Scripture; yee shall not enter into them, neither shall they (meaning strangers) enter into yours, for they will certainely turne away your hearts to followe their Gods.</p>
                     <p>But put the case there were no daunger which a constant minde (though experience teach the contrarie) might not preuent, what peace, what
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176965:230"/> amitie can there be betweene persons so mainely opposite? Beside what will become of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the fruict of mariage? Are they not all in daunger of beeing infected with heresie? Yea is it not couenanted betwixt such persons, that the sonnes be brought vp in their fathers religion, &amp; the daughters in their mothers? What more cruel and detestable couenant then this, to beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be burned in the eternall flames of hell? And what can be more impious, then that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents should haue so litle regard, what faith and religion their children ptofesse?</p>
                     <p>Some Lukewarme Catholiques will answere me; Yea but we will prouide that the children be brought vp Catholiquely. How dangerous is this aduenture? Who knoweth whether of these shal preuaile most with their children? Who can iudge whether carnall affection with the corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ill, will not sway more then true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to good? Besides, while one buildeth and an other destroyeth, what auaileth their labour while one prayeth, and an other curseth, when will God heare? This I thought sitt by the way to touch, not that I reprooue anie yong maiden of transgression who is vncapable of guile in this manner, and yeeldeth a simple obedience to her parents, but that Catholiques may vnderstand, howe iustly such mariages are forbidden, and howe vnhappie they are to their childrē, who are innocently contracted by their parents meanes.</p>

                     <p>LEt vs see how excessiue the rage and furie of this inhumane husband was towards his wife, who transported with deadly hate towards her, inuented diuers molestations and practises, which when they tooke no effect, he attempted to make his wife away treacherously, neither did his bill of diuorce sufficiently satisfie his anger kindled against her, which he sent her by reason of the difference of religion, but he thought on a farre more cruell manner of reuenge. Once as she poore matron was going to visit some of her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, hauing some in her companie who did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her in the high way, her husband hauing notice of it, came with some horsemen, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently assailing her, tooke from her all manner of furniture which she carried, and left her only one mantle to couer her shoulders: which he did to the end, that by such vexation, he might remoue her from her constancie in the profession of her faith. After this imparting his griefe and trouble of minde to some of his friends, he by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise attempted to make her away by poison.</p>
                     <p>The day was determined, on which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all faire outward shewes and pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, giueth order to entertaine his wife
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:176965:231"/> with a great banquet, euen in that castle wherein he caused her to be kept, bearing in her wombe quicke at that time this Sonne Iohn Forbese, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to dispatch both together. But God who had preordained otherwise of this child and the mother, defeated this wicked purpose, who moued sodainely one of the confederates in this designe, to go about midnight to the castle, and to gett vp to the windowe of this poore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, who discouered all this mischieuous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise extended to her the day following. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon fearing vehemently her owne and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des destruction, she aduised with this faithfull messenger, what she was to doe in this case.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at the dawning of the day, she obtained leaue of the keeper of the castle, that for solacing her selfe, she might goe to a castle of one of her kindred, which was but two leagues from that place. The keeper graunted it easily, because he knewe by proofe of her in that kind, that she had faithfully returned, after that (attended with a small retinewe) she had taken a litle recreation by so small a iourney. But when she reuealed the cause of her comming to her kinsman, she remained vnder his garde for a time, iustly refusing to returne with her keeper, and so disappointed her husband of his wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And thereby he grieuouslie offended with his wiues kindred, gaue them occasion to seeke reuenge on him, either by violent and open meanes or by secret, had not their medling beene

Certainly although by false dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation he seemed to haue deposed the former obstinate rancour of minde, yet the blind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate lust towards his strumpet, who could not endure a mate, pricketh him forward to seeke newe wayes, howe he may effect his old wicked deseigne. His seruants likewise did watch thou to depriue the afflicted matrone of her life. As she was once walking on the top of a mountaine for her recreations sake, her husband vnderstanding of it, came in hot furie on a suddaine vpon her beeing mounted on horse backe, and thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to cast her into a riuer, which was at the foote of the hil, hoping perchance (as it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) that vpon a rumour spred, that she was fallen into the riuer, she might be thought to be the authour of her owne death. But while she began to fall, calling vpon God and the Blessed Virgin the mother of God, she was preserued at that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176965:232"/> time. In the meane while this treacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son departed with shame and confusion.</p>
                     <p>An other time hauing suborned a noble person of his bloud, who should falsely accuse her, that she had conceiued by keeping companie with an adulterer, he easily beleeued that by this accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he should obtaine leaue of the Ministers (though the gospel be directly contrarie) to keepe his harlot in steed of a wife, and that hereby he might haue a plausible reason, to make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people beleeue, that he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But when they failed in proofe, these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust iudges found out an other pretext of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to marie a second wife, while his first was liuing. For they decreed that the husband might lawfully take an other wife, because the first was stiffe in her religion, which they called Popish. And this they determined might be done publiquely &amp; solemnely, seeing that the first was to be reputed dead before God in her soule, and most worthy of all shame and ignominie.</p>
                     <p>Amidst all these troubles and persequutions, the vertue and constancie of this noble dame was so eminent, that her verie enemies had her in admiration, in so much that manie noble men, though infected with heresie, did seeke to marrie her, who thought that the mariage was lawfull in regard of the diuorce which her husband had made, and the wrongs which she had sustained. But she by the grace of chastitie which God had giuen her, and not forgetting her troth plighted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176965:232"/> in wed-locke, could neuer be persuaded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit so shamefull an act, as to soile her Christian puritie, or the honour of a Catholique woman. Wherfore she chose rather like a mourning turtle doue, to leade a solitarie life, then liuing in all worldly pleasure, to be reputed false to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to dishonour her children, and to leaue an infamy vpon her most deare infant Iohn Forbese, with whom she was great at that time.</p>
                     <p>Thus she couragiously ouercame al the assaults of those who ceased not to solicite and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her to these euill courses. Neither did she beare all this for a smal time, but very long and patientlie, which happily God in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordained for an example to her children, &amp; the true Catholiques of that countrie. Sweete Iesu how manie waies doest thou exercise in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, those soules whom thou hast chosen for thine, that in some thing they may be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to thy most bitter and holy passion!</p>

                     <p>AFter this noble matron had passed her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile of childbirth, in bringing in to the world this her deare infant Iohn Forbese, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into newe trauaile and paine, in bringing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176965:233"/> him vp with all care and diligence, and giuing him milke of her owne breasts, with which he drewe and suckt the good and sweete nature of his mother. She was not ignorant, that it did not litle auaile for the infusion of pietie into tender age, with what nurses milke children are nouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed: and therefore she thought it no paine to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish him of her owne milke, whom she had nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished of her owne bowels. Wherein manie noble woemen are to be blamed, who refuse to vndergoe the trauaile of nourishing their owne babes. Hence it cometh to passe, that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to other nurses, they drinke in also cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and peruerse manners, with the milke they sucke from them. As soone as the father heard that his lawfull wife had bore him this sonne, he began vpon due consideration to thinke seriously of his lawfull successour of his hereditarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, if peraduenture his eldest sonne should die, or should vpon dislike (as by the euent it selfe it fell out a litle after) fly from him. Wherefore he thought it best by way of prouision for these future in conueniences, that as soone as his child was weaned, he should either by force, or by some slight, be taken frō his mother, and brought vp with him. He often communicated this his purpose to certaine freinds, who counsailed him to the timelie and speedy execution of it, which he did presently after the weaning of the child, which was no small affliction to the mother, to see her child brought vp so contrarie to her good
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176965:233"/> desires. In this case she ceased not to pray for him dayly. Thrice happie child, who began beeing but a tender infant to suffer for iustice, herein giuing good occasion of presage, that he would by Gods holie prouidence be one day a true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique.</p>
                     <p>So was he taken from his mothers breast, to be nourished among wolues and foxes; Before he was borne they would haue depriued him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the visible light, &amp; presently they sought to take from him the inward light of his soule, practising the stratagemes of wicked Naaz, who said he would enter into league with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, vpon condition that he might putt out all their right eyes. But netheir Gods hand, nor the mothers vigilancie was wanting to this child. As he grewe in yeares and vse of reason, his good mother dealt with him by secrete and faithfull messengers, persuading him earnestly to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith, &amp; to the declining from the poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous errours of Protestants; at least she endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to breed some impressions of doubting, least otherwise he might be too deepely seasoned with their wrong instructions. O how much doth it concerne parents in these vnhappie times, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in heretiques liue in common with Catholiques, to take great heede least their children be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their conuersation! Their speech (as the Apostle saith) creepeth like a canker. It is not sufficient for parents to haue begotten children in flesh, yf they neglect to beget them in Christ.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176965:234"/> This belongeth to Parents. Instruct thy sonne, saith the wise man; and Ecclesiasticus saith. If thou hast children instruct them and bowe them from their childhood. For in that age their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is like to a white frame which is readie to receiue anie kind of figure or image, or like vnto white woll, which as yet hath not had anie die, or like a yong twig, which may be easily bowed anie way, but what image, coulour, or plie they take at first, these are likely to continue. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they loue their sonnes, let them teach them what belongeth to the seruice of God, for he that hath pitie, teacheth &amp; instructeth as a shepheard doth his flocke. For it is certaine, that euen as the branches of trees cannot bing forth fruict, vnlesse the roote and truncke afford them vitall sappe: so can not children bring forth fruicts of vertue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse their parents minister to them, the fruitfull sappe of good education and discipline, which they ought to doe no lesse by good examples then precepts. For all inferiours doe more obserue examples then words, and children doe easily abstaine from euill, if they see a horrour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of it in their parents: whereas on the contrarie part, if they see their parents forbeare not to doe it, the custome of beholding, taketh libertie of imitation, as Valerius Maximus saith.</p>
                     <p>In this kind of instruction, parents doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie benefitt their children, but themselues also most of all in the sight of God and men. Howe acceptable this is to God for their owne good,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176965:234"/> the Scripture testifieth, by that which fell out to Abraham. Can I hide (saith God) from Abraham what I will doe? for I knowe that he wil instruct his children and his house after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, and doe iudgement and iustice, and before men they receiue benefit. For a wise sonne is the glorie of his Father, and on the contrarie part, a foolish sonne, is the grief of his father. Hence Eccleasticus saith. Praise no man before death, because a man is knowne in his children: and againe, Take no pleasure in wicked children if they be multiplied, neither be delighted in them, if the feare of God be not in then: doe not trust to their life, that is, trust not although thou doost see them in good health &amp; strong, &amp; doe not respect their labours by which they performe great and noble acts, to procure you in your opinion a suruiuing sonne &amp; name. For one fearing God, is better then a thousand impious persons, and it is better to die without childrē, then to leaue wicked ones; For impious children doe dishonour their parents, &amp; prouoke Gods wrath. Therefore to preuent this euil in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a bad issue, let parents teach them to feare God, euen from their cradle; Let them consider that if they be careful, that they may conueniētly vnderstand matters of this world, and how they may be gracious in humane societie, howe much more is it necessarie to take care, that they may knowe their dutie to God, and howe to please him. This was the principall care of this pious

                     <p>AS the mother was carefull of her yonger sonne, so was she as carefull for the setling and strengthning of her elder sonne, according to his age, in the true faith. Whereas he was much grieued with the wrong and dishonour done to his mother, he went boldly to his father, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that he was minded to trauaile into foraine countries, and as occasion should be offered, to beare armes in some honourable seruice. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing his auersion from him selfe, and stoutnesse in defending his mothers cause (wheras the sisters held with the father) gaue way to the motion, and lett him goe. He arriued happily in the lowe countries, and offering his seruice to the most warlike Prince of Parme, was well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of him, and so had for some time a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion paid him from the Catholique king, and his table in the companie of other noble gentlemen, who belonged to the Prince.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:176965:235"/> his countrie, his domaines and lands due to him by inheritance, by the sweete inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holie ghost, he entred into the order of the Friars Cappucins, which order that noble Prince of Parma (much deuoted to the blessed &amp; Seraphicall Father S.

And hauing obtained the Popes Bull for confirmation of it, he planted thē in their first seate at Antwerpe. Shortly after died the brother of Archangell, hauing liued but a short time in the foresaid order: who leauing a sweete odour of good commendation behind him, for his abstinence and singular feruour in prayer, went to take possession of a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heauen, then that which he had left on earth for Christs sake. He ended his life in the Quire at the time of the Complie, hauing past the day in the common exercises of the brethren, &amp; accustomed labours, so that from the Quire of religious persons singing psalmes he went to the Quire of Angels, to be ioyned in consort with those yong minstrell Maydens, that is of holie and of blessed soules.</p>

                     <p>WHereas by occasion of treating of the elder brother, there was speach offered concerning the Duke of Parma, I thought it meete to speake briefly touching his singular deuotion, towards
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176965:236"/> the Seraphicall order, for which we may piously beleeue, that God rewarded him for his good wil and deuout affection, which is as acceptable to him, as the worke it selfe, when it cannot be put in execution. For it is well knowne, that this Duke after greate victories which he had gotten of his enemies, after manie labours and trauailes sustained for the deliuerie of the lowe countries, did earnestly couett some quiet repose and rest of minde, by which he might not without the foile of the greatest enemies of eternall blisse, dispose his soule to God for a happie passage.</p>
                     <p>To the effecting whereof he determined with himselfe, incited the rather by the exāple of this noble Scotish man, the brother of our Iohn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bese, to enter into that religion which he had first brought into that countrie. And he had entred without doubt, if he had not beene hindred by the right reuerend Father by name, Monsieur Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernois, his most eloquent preacher, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Bishop of S.

Whereupon saith his Preacher. Sir, be of of good courage, when the French warres be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you shall obtaine my leaue (but I knowe not whether the Catholique king will grant you it) to performe your vowe. A litle after the

But the sharpenesse of the flesh, is the sweetenesse of the spirit and soule. God be mercifull to his soule and reward him, for all the good which he did, in defence of his countrie and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith.

He being thus moued, both by the aduise of his mother and his brother, and assisted from aboue by grace, which the teares and sighes of both of them, did beg for him at the length, fearing more to offend God then his Father, he went to his vnkle, whose presence in those parts was wincked at by reason of his noble birth, and the conniuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his owne kindred, which were the chiefe Princes.</p>

He knewe well enough for al this, what his father had said before to some of his familiar friends, when he first espied the Agnus Dei about hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> necke, he brake forth into these words. And will my second sonne also be a Papist? Therefore it was necessarie for him to vse all good circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection and to take courage. Herein his witt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him not, neither was gods helpe wanting.</p>
                     <p>On a certaine day, as he was sporting himselfe in hunting, being in companie with others of his owne yeares and qualitie, it happened as he was separated farre from his companions, and being wearie of following his game, and reposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by a hedge side, there appeared to him a great number of religious men in a poore habit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to him, going in a decent order; whom he wondring at, was ignorant of what order they were, or what they ment: yet vnwardly he felt himselfe much affected to them, and much moued to the imitation of them. Considering this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deepely with himselfe, and laying it vp verie safe, he fell to examine this vision, and not able to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176965:240"/> pearce into the meaning of it, prayed God that he would reueale to him his holie will, which not with standing he neuer perfectly knewe, till by Gods prouidence he came to Antuerpe: where when he mett with the Cappucins before he was witting of anie such companie, he presently called to minde his old vision, and preceiued that he was thereby called and inuited, to followe Christ by voluntarie pouertie and contempt of the world, vnder the rule of the Seraphicall Father S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and so he found flames of his desire daylie kindled in himself.</p>
                     <p>Iohn Forbese after he was professed some yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, related this for a truth to some of the brethrē, who were most inwardly acquainted with him. He therefore entertaining more and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thoughtes, being preuented by Gods holie inspiration, began to thinke howe and in what manner he might easily shunne the snares of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, which put him in greate dāger while he liued among them in his owne countrie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his father, his sister, his vniust step mother, and finally all with whom he was faine to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, were tainted with heresie, he might liue vertuously and deuoutly after the precepts of the Catholique faith. Hauing therefore receiued aduertisements from his mother, by way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against these dangers, and strengthned by his vnkles instructions, he determined to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe a voluntarie exile and banishment, and set himself the last day, where in he would make
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176965:241"/> his last feast and iollitie with his spouse. Which time being expired, when as both his father and his brides parēts, with greate concourse of noble persons, came to congratulate those mariages promised and prepared (I knowe not after what rites or manner of Protestants) he seing the houre of the night drewe on when all the guests would tetire themselues, he tooke this virgin (scarcely mariage-able for her yeares) a part, and after his wonted louing greetings and speeches, fetching a deepe sigh, he spake vnto her in this manner.</p>
                     <p>My beloued and deare virginall sister, you see howe our parents doe seeke to ioyne vs in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, being as yet both verie yong, what can become of this, but chat we shall be committed to we knowe not what tutours and gardians, who will make their owne priuate profit by vs. The state of mariage requireth more prudence and maturitie of iudgment, then is incident to our tender age. Wherefore I am earnesly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat this fauour of you, with your good liking, that before we vndergoe this yoake, I may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile a while into foraine countries, and we shall haue time to accomplish that businesse, which our vnripe age nowe doth not so well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. To this she made a milde replie, not she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing anie trouble of minde hereupon. Your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position said she, is verie reasonable, God speed you in your iourney, and send you a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne. And yf happily you shall change your minde and affection, I wish you better fortune,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176965:241"/> them you should haue had yf you had liued with me. God forbid, saith the yong man, that I should entertaine anie such thought. What soeuer I haue saide, I haue spoken syncerely and from my heart; yet there is an other secrete which I would impart to you, yf you will promise me by your noble and good disposition, to conceale it. She not vnlike one other sexe, desirous to knowe what it was, said presently. I doe make you this promise. Then he began thus.</p>
                     <p>O my sweete heart, I doe much pittie thy case, who hauing other contentments of life doest followe blind guides and conductours. I haue beene hitherto with thee in damnable dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse, &amp; haue beene nulled by my kinsmen and friends. There is no other faith, but only the Romane Catholique faith which leadeth to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. I thanke God nowe by his holie inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and instruction of a good guide, I knowe that I speake a truth, and I confesse my self to be a Catholique, and your soule is as deare to me as mine owne: therefore I request you, that we louing one an other, may haue the same will in louing God, and embracing the true faith. When she heard these speeches from him, she was much astonished, but presently recouering her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, she replied. If anie other besids your selfe should giue me this counsell, I should esteeme it for idle and vaine; But I haue great confidence in you, that you would not in anie sort delude me, but that you tender my good as heartily as your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176965:242"/> owne. Yet I thinke it meete to take some respit to thinke of this, being a matter of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, least I be reputed for rash and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in forsaking the religion in which I haue beene brought vp hitherto.</p>
                     <p>Wel, saith he, least you may haue occasion to wauer, if herein you should rest on my iudgemēt, I will prouide that you shall haue an instructour for vertuous life and learning, beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I meane my vnkle Gordon, who hath wrought my conuersion. And I doubt not, but after consideration of his meeke conuersation, &amp; his euident proofes of the Catholique Roman faith, you will put great difference betweene that which consisted only in speech, and that which is truly powerfull and effectuall. For the kingdome of God is not in wordes, but in vertue and power: then shal you discerne manifestly, whether that be true religiō, which in power of the worde, ministreth faith, in faith vertue, &amp; in vertue know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; in knowledge abstinēce, &amp; in abstinence, patience, and in patience pietie, and in pietie loue of fraternitie, and in loue of fraternitie charitie. Whether that be likely to be true, which only speaketh good wordes, or that which doth that which it saith. In the end she was pleased with his discourse (so sweetely tempered with much affection) and followed his counsell. And for the most part it falleth out, that sectaries are gained sooner by faire meanes and good wordes, then by rough dealing.</p>

                     <p>HAuing ended this discourse with this noble Damoiselle, and hauing well performed this worke of charitie towards her, he departed.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176965:243"/> his elder brother had left it to him, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in to religion) neglecting noble descent, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the hereticall poison, of his companie with whom he was bred and likewise infected, till he was about fourteene yeares of age: relinquishing moreouer his sweete countrie, and the grace of the king: leauing (I cā not but repeate it) his spouse of equall ranke, who was to him, the one halfe of his owne soule, representing herein an other Alexius.</p>
                     <p>The day before the feast of which noble Sainct, he ranne downe from the castle, as though for recreation sake he would sport himselfe in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and youthfull exercise. Vnder which cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour being come some distance from his fathers house, by making some youthful leaping, he ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a lad which was one of his fathers shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, feeding a flocke of sheepe, with whom, being of his owne yeares he disported: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occasion, at length said to him. Let vs chāge cloaths, Giue me thine and thou shalt haue mine. To whom the shepheard answered; I dare not, least I should be beaten of your Father. Feare not said he, it is I that bid thee doe it, I meane to to make my father merrie, I will goe to our feast so disguised, and giue occasion of mirth, I wil ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were for thee: If thou wilt not, I will make thee. The yong shepheard obeyed him, and the noble yong man soe fled, and was not seene after. He litle regarded what would happen to this poore lad, but folwed that counsell which is giuen in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176965:243"/> Genesis. Saue thy soule, doe not looke backe. Hence he manifested to vs the wordes of our Sauiour. I came not to bring peace, but the sword, to make diuision betweene the Father and the sonne, betweene the mother and daughter, and a mans enemies, ar his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestiques. O admirable separation, which is made not by a materiall sworde but by the sword of God! We doe see some times an only son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, not onlie to despise all earthly substance, and whatsoeuer belongeth to it, but also with a cheerefull heart and ioyfull countenance, to leaue his parents and to retire himselfe from the iolitie and pleasure of this world, to a hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life. In so much that neither the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lamentations nor mothers weepings, can retaine him, in whose heart this two edged sword of the spirit, worketh this most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull separation, hauing force to diuide aboue the reach of nature.</p>
                     <p>Iohn Forbese felt the edge of this sword in him selfe, in this separation which was made, not by his owne, but by diuine power, in the flower and first feruour of his youth, being nowe but seauenteene yeares of age. Wherein he was a true and perfect follower of Alexius, euen abhorringe (which he shewed by flying from them) once to tast of those alluring bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the false and fading contentments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world. Thrice happie herein was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176965:244"/> he who forsooke them before he was forsaken of them. This is a strong and inuincible proofe of the spirit of God, dwelling in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que church by speciall grace, since we see such heroical acts of pietie no where else to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yea rather to be slighted ouer or reputed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible among sectaries. The magicians of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao, when they could not shewe those signes which Moises did, iustly cried out to Pharao. This is the finger of God! And the Apostle Saint Paul saith. The presence of God may be plainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the spirit of prophecie, of those that enter into the congregation, who can not forbeare to say that God is among you.</p>
                     <p>Who then will not acknowledge the finger of God in the church, and God to be trulie in it, wherein so manie noble heroicall workes are done by Catholiques? Why are they not euident signes of Gods spirit dwelling in it? Saint Iames speaking of the signes of true religion saith. The Wisedome which is from aboue, is first chast. Howe then can the wisedome of heretiques be from God, to whom this first note is wanting? whereas there are none among them who haue the gift of continencie, but euerie one (and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie the ministers) must haue his wife because of fornication, and euerie woman her husband, there is none among them who will choose that state, although S. Paul doth counsaile all to it, and that by the spirit of God, as to that which is the better: Which as it enableth it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176965:244"/> without impediment to pray to God, and to all good deuotions, so doth it make vs more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But all choose that which is graunted by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and indulgence, neither is it counsailed but onlie to auoide euill.</p>
                     <p>It is no smal meruaile, that they who brag that they receiue all the words of the holie Gospell, haue none among them, who can or will receiue this worde: That it is not expedient to marrie. That there is none among them who will make himselfe chast for the kingdome of heauen sake, and renoūce those carnall pleasures. And likewise while they glorie in reformation, that there are none who will freely forsake their wiues &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions for Christs sake, but doe thinke Christs counsaile a matter of impossibilitie. But how should they leaue their owne possessions, whose profession is to robbe other men if they can, at least couet to doe it if they can not? For what spoile haue they made of church goods, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of possessions of Catholiques? Therfore it is a manifest signe, that they haue not the spirit of God, but a carnall earthly and diuelish spirit; For the spirit which is of the earth, speaketh of the earth, and sauoureth of those things which are of the flesh.</p>

                     <p>THis first euening of his voiage vndertaken, tooke he vp a lodging which he lighted vpō in his way, hauing verie litle money on his parte, trusting much to Gods prouidence, being a louer of Christian pouertie; Where, as he was refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing his wearie delicate bodie, not accustomed to such trauaile, three noble Scotish men came into the house, whom he knewe verie familiarlie, whō as soone as he espied, he was greately afraid, that they were sent after him by his father. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was put to inuent some willie shift for him selfe. Soe presently he ranne into the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney corner, and drawing downe on his browes his old shepheards cap, he began to groane and shiuer, as though he had a fitt of an ague: and so was no more regarded then a poore sicke lad, who was glad to creepe into a chimney corner. The next day verie earely, he setteth forward on his iourney, which both by sea and land he passed with great courage, though not without much paine. At length by Gods helpe he came to the wished place and hauen, where he embarqued himselfe in a small boate for Antwerpe. But he could not come to Antwerpe, but by passing a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176965:245"/> castle nere to Lillo, some three miles distant frō it.</p>
                     <p>Here certaine wicked soldiours both English and Scotish, sought to stay him, for he would not reueale to them who he was, thinking him fit for his yeares to be employed in the gard with them. But he gott out of their hands by his owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and hauing escaped this danger, he fell into a greater, arrested by a soldiour of the king of Spaine, who suspected him for a spie: the rather because he chaunced to see silke stockings, vnder his long shepheards gabardine, hauing forgotten for hast to change his stockings, as he did his other cloaths. Hereupon this soldiour at the commandement of his Captaine, D. Labeui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot gouernour at that time of the fort Noordame, led him prisoner to the castle of Antwerpe, and there presented to the Gouernour de Mondrago, he rūneth a secōd hazard; For being asked for his passeport, he answered he had none, immediately he was cōmitted to prison, to be examined as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure did permitt, and was in danger either of the racke to be more exactly interrogated, or of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to be dispatched speedily out of the way.</p>
                     <p>But be of good courage, o noble youth, haue patience to abide in prison til we haue beheld the tumult of this tragedie, which happened both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōg thy kinsmē, &amp; through al thy coūtry for thy absence: Repose thy selfe in the inward closett of thine owne soule, being humble in thine owne eyes, yet fixe thy hope aboue in Gods prouidence watching ouer thee. Both these holds ar fit refuges for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176965:246"/> Catholiques newly conuerted, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh his minde by sitting downe at the table where Angells serue, and no earthly food is to be had. In the meane while I may say that thou art one of them, of whom the Apostle spake. Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting redemption that they might finde a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter resurrection, had triall of mockerie &amp; stripes, moreouer also of bandes and prisons: they went about in sheepe skins, in goates skins, needie, in distresse, afflicted, of whom the world was not worthie, wandering in deserts, in mountaines, dennes, and caues of the earth, and all these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the testimonie of faith, because they suffered all this for the testimonie of faith.</p>
                     <p>The shepheard staid long in the field, clad in his Masters sonnes rich habit, expecting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. When he sawe he came not, he brought his sheepe to the fold. Those who sawe him all in silke, wondered at this noueltie, especially his master with all his familie. They thought at the first it was a matter of sport, and that the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would recreat himselfe in this manner. The shepheard being asked, how of a shepheard he became such a gentleman, he answered. The wheele of fortune turneth all thinges. At the length required to tell what this meant, he told the whole historie of this businesse, betweene his Masters sonne and him. His father receiuing contentment vpon this narration, and thinking that his sonne was with his spouse, and was there playing the shepheard by way of meriment, he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:176965:246"/> slept that night without anie trouble of minde. But when his sonne did not returne, nether the next day, nor the day after, and being sought for in the house where his spouse was, coulde not be founde, nor coulde it be knowen where he was, this former mirth of his, ended in mourning, and his ioy in much heauinesse.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this occasion, the yong shepheard was verie carefully examined: who, when he could not say anie other thing for himself, then that he was forced to change his garments by his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters sonne, to the end he might make sport for his friends who were mett to feast together, he was laid in prison with bolts at his heeles, for his frinds began to suspect, that this shepheard had killed him, either by the instigatiō of some other greate person, or by some wilie plott of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteresse, of whom we haue spoken before. They suspected that they had secretely buried him, whererpon manie graues were opened, and dead bodies taken out, for search of his bodie; And so they sought in vaine him that liued truly in Christ, among they dead. When they found him not among the liuing nor dead, manie were sent into all coasts, towards Italie, France, Holland, and by the Kings commandement through all Britannie. But they lost their labour, so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly did he carie himself, that he made manie windings &amp; turnings, asking of diuers whom he mett, diuersly the way, till he sawe he was in a safe and secure place. Therefore when husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:176965:247"/> were asked, whether they had seene on paste in that habit which he wore, they varied much in telling which way he was gone. The poore shepheard was kept in prison two yeares, but God preserued him being innocent from being put to death, and happily the rather by the prayers of his yong maister, who was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie banished man. God graunt also he may be deliuered from blindnesse of minde, and enioye the true light of our holie Catholique faith.</p>

                     <p>It may here be demanded, how his departure could be vnknowne to his mother?

And besides, had he had so easie accesse vnto her, he might iudge it verie inconuenient to make her acquainted ther with, least his father might take occasiō thereby of augmēting his cruelty towards his deare mother. Therefore he prudētly thought it meete to impart this matter to his confessour and his spouse, who was a faithfull keeper of the trust reposed in her.

                     <p>LEt vs returne to visit this stranger, whom we left imprisoned in the castle of Antwerpe. Methinkes his countenance is cheerefull &amp; gay.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176965:248"/> This is an euident proofe that God forsooke him not in prison. The keeper of the castle (in whose sight he found much fauour) gaue him liberty to conuerse with his people, he being readie to serue them in carying of wood and water, and doing all drudging worke, in so much that the master of the house and his people, and likewise his fellowe prisoners, had him in great admiratiō for his sweete fashion of cariage towards all, for his vertuous and good life, and cheerefulnesse in his great want: but principally that in the silence of the night, he retired himselfe secretely to his prayers and deuotions. So did Paulus and Silas when they were in bands, who at midnight did not cease to laude God. When the keeper of the prison related this to the Gouernour, he was farre from suspecting him for a vagabond person or a spie, who was so vertuous. Therefore compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionating his case, he gaue order for his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and willed the keeper to forgiue him his fees and arrereages in prison, &amp; to repaire his los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by making his profit and gaine of some richer person hereafter. He had but thirtie six stiuers in his purse, of which money the keeper tooke twentie eight. He also offered him his silke stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, of which we spake before, but he tooke them not, but left them to his keeper.</p>
                     <p>Being deliuered out of prison, he enquired out our Ladies church, bearing great deuotion to our B. Ladie. There he humbly rendred all thankes vnto her blessed sonne and her, for their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:176965:249"/> of him and preseruation. He daily frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this church with extraordinarie deuotion and fasting, of which a certaine good Priest taking notice, wondred at his feruour, and inuited him to take a meales meate with him. He first asked him what countrie man he was. He answered, I am a Scottish man, and am come out of my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untrie, that I may saue my soule among good Catholiques. But Sir (said he) howe are they called I pray you, whom I saw, going two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, passe through the church, after they had humbly prostrated themselues on the earth? The deuout Priest, perceiuing more by his signes then by his language (vnknowen to him) after whō he enquired, told him they were Cappucins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared to him as well as he could, their rule and their manner of life.</p>
                     <p>This yong man presently remembring the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that appeared to him in Scotland, whē he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed him in a wood being wearie after hunting, moued with an extraordinarie ardour of spirit, brake forth presently into these speeches. I desire aboue all things to become a Cappucin. Come (saith the Priest) my sonne, and I will bring you to the house of the spirituall father of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, which was then the father of Roger Claris now liuing, a worthie man and a great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the poore. Who immediatly being inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto by his daughter, and out of a bountifull minde, comforted and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this yong man, and at length entertained
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176965:249"/> him at his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>able, though he had a naturall abhorring of poore straungers, in that case as he was in, full of filth and lice. But the vertue which did shine eminently in this yong mans face, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this apprehension, so that his foresaid dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter in lawe, in fauour and commendation of this stranger would say. I would to God our children were of as good behauiour as this yong man.</p>
                     <p>After one or two daies, his noble hoste kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his good desires, brought him to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins, his spirituall children, to whom he reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the secretes of his heart, in fauour of this straunger. Vpon the sight of him they also much affected him, and especially for his holie desire: yet was there one great barre in the way, because he had no language but his owne natiue, whereas it was requisite that he should not onlie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Latin tongue, but the Dutch also, or the French in some reasonable manner. For Forbese his father, would not permit his sonne to learne so much, as the first rudiments of the Latine ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, least some knowledge might giue him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of reading of bookes, and applying his minde to his studies, and so happily thereby might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Catholique.</p>
                     <p>When this blessed exiled man for Christs sake, heard the Cappucins iudgement of him, he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered them in word and gesture, that he had no need of the Latin tongue, being minded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a lay brother in this holie congregation,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176965:250"/> and most willing to serue the Priests in all baser and more seruile offices: which offer of his, gaue no small contentement to them. But they seemed much to doubt of his sufficient strength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of bodie for that end, and therefore they persuaded him to followe his studies with other poore schollers of the citie. In the meane time with some trauaile he might learne the Dutch tongue, &amp; growing daily to yeares of more iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, might make good proofe of himselfe, whether he would persist in the choice of this religious state.</p>
                     <p>He followed, as an obedient child the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of his elders, and by reason of want and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurie, frequented sometimes one schole, someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes an other. He vsed extraordinarie diligence in obseruing and carying away his Masters lessons. When he had obtained to be admitted in anie schole but for a short time, it is almost incredible how much he suffered, and what paines he tooke that he might attaine to that which he aimed at, which was to be a poore Cappucin. And that he might more frugally releiue himself, he graued litle images either in ledd or wood, which some of his schoole fellowes sought to gett from him, and would giue him either pieces of bread and butter, or else some portions of flesh in exchange for them. Sometimes his necessitie was such, that he would search his schoolefellowes sachels for some poore fragments which they would not eate, such as is giuen to hogs, and such would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176965:250"/> he eate verie hungrily and sauourily.</p>

                     <p>IMmediatly after his deliuerie out of prison, he slept euerie night for six weekes space like a vagabond or poore companion, in a litle lodge made of wood, which the citizens were wont to vse for their watch: there he had a cold lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and vneasie resting place for his delicate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vnaccustomed to such extremitie, by which we may see what force Christian feruour hath, euen in yong impes.

He answered he had in one place, marie a most remote part of the countrie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein master Alexander knewe no man. Finally this yong man went away with the victorie he sought in defending his owne cause, which was to be reputed still a poore and bare wretch; So that both in his flight, and in his place of abode, he might be a true follower of holie Alexius.</p>
                     <p>His countrieman asked him, whether he was not much amazed with his late imprisonment and feare of hanging, which was threatned to him by the Gouernour of the castle?

Behold with what grace he was fortified against all these terrible batteries, which assaults of the deuill he ouercame stoutly, though not without difficultie.

                     <p>THE formamed master Alexander, being much incited by the cariage of this yong man, and principally by his comportement in the schoole maisters house, brought his Master and him to Lewis Claris, a most sweet patron of

Here vpon this honourable patron of the poore, promised to pay an hundred florens for him to his maister, for his table and teaching. By this meanes being holpen and refreshed, vsing exact diligence, he learned verie commendably the Latin tongue, and the Dutch, sufficiently for his vse.

If she should see thee (I say) helping thy schoole-maisters maid-seruāts, not only in washing dishes, but in scowring thē, and doing such drudging worke in the kitchin, or eating hungrily some knawed crusts or fragmēts, which other children had left, wouldest thou haue runne away for shame, and forsaken these exercises which were pleasing to thee?

                     <p>Doubt not (deare Reader) though thou seest not these great tentations, take place or trouble this yong man outwardly, but that inwardly through the suggestion of the deuill, the flattering and tickling of naturall corruption, he had terrible combats. But there is noe glorious victorie got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, where the fight is not fought, and by how much the enemie is more potent, the fight lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and sharper, by so much is the conquest more honourable and more gratefull.

                     <p>HIs first and principall motion to be a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucin was, because he seemed to be called by that vnexpected vision (where of we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken) to this order; And besides, whereas he was desirous to embrace the most Apostolicall rule of life, the thought this religious sort of life, to be most agreable to that rule. He considered the austeritie of life in the Professours of this rule, &amp; their roughnesse &amp; coursnesse of habit, hardly able to keepe off the cold. He remembred the words of Christ. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>That they who are cloathed in soft garments, are in kings houses.</hi> He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to minde, that the Apostles followed Christ
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176965:254"/> in vile garments, for they were poore fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; neither did they putt off those garments, and put on finer or more costly to follow Christ. He reflected also vpon those words of S. Paul, <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. who sayed of himselfe, that he was more then others in cold and nakednesse, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding could not separate him frō the loue of Christ, though his sufferings were not small. He also knewe, that the witnesses of God should prophecie, cloathed with sacke cloth, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. and he remembred also the word of our Lord. <hi>Marc.</hi> 6. <hi>Carie not purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, but bee shoed with sandals.</hi> He considered also their sparenesse in dyet, who vsing verie often fasting, did often ten times onlie eate hearbs and pulse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: finally, did seeke their meate from doore to doore, and had nothing else. Soe they liue casting all their care vpon God, because he hath care of vs.</p>
                     <p>He had read also, how the Apostles for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did pull the eares of corne, passing by the corne fields; and also what the Apostle speaketh of himselfe and his fellowes in the Apostleship. <hi>Vntill this houre we doe both hunger and thirst, and are naked, are beaten with buffets, and are wanderers, and labour, working with our owne hands.</hi> He did also thinke vpon the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of money, which all things obey, and which all men couett, remembring what Christ had said. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>Doe not possesse gold nor siluer, nor money in your purses: Actor.</hi> 1.8.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176965:254"/> and knewe that money was the perdition of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and Simon. He vnderstood also, that the pouertie of this religion was such, that they doe not only renonce al proprietie in particular but in common, calling to minde our Sauiours words. <hi>The foxes haue holes, and the foules of the aire nests, but the sonne of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> All these premises being well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him, he concluded noe rule to be more Apostolicall and perfect then this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entred into this with greate feruour and deuotion.</p>
                     <p>Who can well expresse the ioy and exultation of spirit, which this yong man had, when he once obtained that which he had long desired, for desires prolonged, growe more and more? How ioyful a thing had it beene, to haue seene the great and blessed armie in heauen, who were rancked vnder Saint Francis coulours, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing this day, and reioycing at the admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this new enroled yong champion? Surelie those heauenly mountaines leaped like rammes, and the hills of religious in this earthly campe, like yong lambes. This was certainly a happie day, and very remarqueable to the honour of God. He tooke the Cappucins habit the 23. yeare of his age, and the yeare of our Lord 1593. at Tournay, vpon the daye of the litle Portion which is a daye so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized to our blessed Ladie the second of August: to her I say, as the singular patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176965:255"/> of the litle flocke, and small portion of religious brethren, assembled togeither in S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis time, in a church dedicated to our blessed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The yeare following vpon the same day he made his profession, and the verie same day thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares after his Nouice-ship, he ended his life, as we will shewe here after: which was a good signe, that his seruices performed to the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of that virgin, and offered vp vpon such a day, were gratefull to the virgin, to whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes singularly deuout.</p>
                     <p>At his first entrance into religion (as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie custome is) he changed his name, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas he was called before Iohn, he was afterward called brother Archangel. Hauing now taken the habit of a penitent, it was strange with what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he serued almightie God, in true feare and doue-like simplicitie of hart, especially in that age which is so prone to all worldly delights, which he well shewed in daily chastising his bodie, and bringing of it into subiection (yet vnder the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete bridle of his Superiour.) Whereby so farre are they frō not reaping the fruict of their pious trauaile, which is ordered by the circumspect care of others, that they merit much more by vertue of their obedience, which is the eldest and first bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne daughter of humilitie. And what meruaile if hauing laid a sure foundation of humilitie, he raised the rest of a faire building, in all kind of vertues answerable thereto? The eyes of our Lord regard the voluntarie poore, and he doth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176965:255"/> assure them of him selfe, who put their assurance in him first. And when God hath taken anie into protection, who is there who can take him out of his handes?</p>
                     <p>Certaine Scotishmen, wise according to the flesh, who were fled into the Low countries for their faith, vnderstanding that a yong Scotish man, should shortly make his profession among the Cappucins, searching and enquiring what he should be, doe persuade themselues (neither was their persuasion vaine) that he was nobly borne: and as they obserued his countenance and his gesture, they began to suspect, that this was the noble yong man, who flying out of his countrie, had forsaken his noble Spouse, of whom they had heard such strange matters. Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie further deliberation, they concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues, that this matter was to be proposed to the Doctours and Professours of the vniuersitie of Doway, in this sort. Whether it be lawfull for a noble gentleman, who is his fathers heire and eldest sonne, to abandon his house and familie, to the preiudice of his owne countrie &amp; Catholique religion? They answere, that it is in no case lawfull. So that by the instance of these men, the yong Nouice is called before our maisters in a solemne meating, and by precept of obedience, he is persuaded to leaue this purpose, yea he is told, that he is bound in conscience so to doe. All doe expect the yong mans answer, who after this sentence giuen, spake with greate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176965:256"/> feruour of minde, yet tempered well with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, saying.</p>
                     <p>Good Sirs, I am verie weake and vnable in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and worne already both with in and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with long penurie and hunger, and by sharpe discipline I am feeble and blood-lesse. I am not fit either for warre or procreation of children. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding if you hinder my profession in this countrie, I will goe to an other. If I be there hindred also, I will retire my selfe to some solitarie life, where as no man shall finde me out. Vpon this speech all men fell into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment of his constancie, &amp; cryed out with one voice. This calling is from God, Goe sonne in peace. It is held an euident signe of an elected soule when the deuil raiseth manie impediments to those, who would enter into a religious course of life, which hath befallen manie Saincts of both sexes. So during the time of his Nouice ship, he concealed his noble familye, so that he liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne among his brethren, being thought to be the sonne of some poore Scotishman, alwayes readie to performe all vile and base seruices of religion, both in will and deed, both before and after his profession. So that if this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had not arriued, and thereupon if he had not by vertue of obedience, beene forced to tel the truth, he would neuer haue made anie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the same, so great a desire he had of despising him selfe. And when he told the Guardian and his maister this, he humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:176965:256"/> them to keepe it to themselues, and not to publish it to anie of the brethren; And by this meanes he remained as befor vnknowne to them.</p>
                     <p>Hence it came to passe that he was called vpon oftner, both by the Seniours and his brethrem, to doe manie drudgeries, and had no humane fauour shewed him in sparing him from those troubles which are incident to religious persons. And this is our manner to exercise them, who are with vs in the schoole of the crosse, that they may learne by the example of Christ, to suffer seriously eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, and in all things. Yet I did much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (whē I after knewe what he was) that he bore all without the least contradiction, without anie discontentment in outward shewe, yea certainly most cheerefully and gladly.</p>
                     <p>He was so willing to suffer, that once when a matter was imposed vpon him, of which he was no way guiltie, which was so greate that a Nouice might haue beene dismissed for it, notwithstāding although he was most innocent, he neuer spake one word in defence of his innocencie, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the defence of his innocencie to God. For his diet he was of that temperance, that he was not only an enemie to gluttonie, but to the least pleasure and delight which might be taken in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his meate. He was often seene vpon fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dayes (which are frequent with vs) when fish was sett before him, though not fresh but salt, either not once to haue tasted of it, although hūger did prouoke him to it, or if by the cōmandemēt of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:176965:257"/> his Superiour he did eate of it, he would not dippe his fish into the butter which was serued with the fish, least he might haue the least inordinate pleasure, which he thought was hard to auoide, euen while we satisfie nature in eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. For manie other mortifications which he endured, I shall haue occasion to speake of them hereafter.</p>

                     <head>He maketh his profession, and followeth his studies. His good life and manners, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his profession. THE XVII. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>AFter so manie conflicts of mortification, hauing made his profession, he is sent for to studie into a Conuent designed for the studies of Philosophie, vnder a reader of our owne order. There F. Arch. was first knowne to me, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene him before. Neither is it fit for Iuniours to enquire curiouslie of what familie and nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie others are, but to consider well in what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of vertue and pietie they doe excell. And then I did diligently obserue, and so did manie moe with me, the gesture and comportement of this stranger. First I did note his modest and humble countenance and looke, his composed and well ordered manner of gate, both at home and abroad. For he which doth not carie himselfe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:176965:257"/> as well in his Conuent and in his cel, as he doth abroad in the streets, is to be iudged an hypocrite. He humbled himselfe to doe all vile offices verie promptly, he was the first for the most part, in washing the dishes and dish clouts: vpon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed dayes he swept the house, yea he tooke often a conuenient time to make cleane the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, which he did the more secretly, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing of himselfe, might not seeme to proceed from so much humilitie.</p>
                     <p>When he tooke care of the sacristie, you would haue iudged him as an Angel of God, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring in a holie place and in the church, he kept all things so neatly and so sweetly. He prepared all things in time, and by his diligence, kept all the ornaments verie decent, and verie beautifull, shining with a pleasing splendour and lustre of honourable pouertie. Forced pouertie is filthie, but voluntarie is neate and cleanly. Therefore this rule is often taught by the Cappucins. Let pouertie be cleane and neate. He had a care to keepe the walls, the pauement, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes from all filth: yet in all these externall seruices, he was carefull to keepe God in his heart, with a most amorous affection: for this is the maine scope and butt of all. He visited the sicke with that carefullnesse and true charitie, that the sicke were wonderfully comforted by his presence with them. For as occasion serued, either he would speake to them sweete words of comfort, or strengthen them which were faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:176965:258"/> in this or the like manner. Take courage deare brother, our B. Sauiour Iesus is on the crosse with you, he is neuer more easie to be found, then in affliction. If you are gold, you are tried of him: if drosse you are purged. With which kinde of exhortations, the sicke were readie to endure their sicknesse patiently, and as long as it pleased God, to exercise them in their affliction. In euerie sicke person, he considering our Sauiour Iesus wearied with labour &amp; sorrowe spake vnto thē on his knees, and after some short speech, he presentlie fell to worke in seruing the sicke. He would make cleane those vessells which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for them, sweepe all places about them, and wipe off their sweate with a towell. To conclude, he did all necessarie duties with all speed, If he were to watch, if the canonicall hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res were to be said, in answering one the other, he was readie for all good offices.</p>
                     <p>Hauing performed these things, he went to the common seruice of the brethren. He was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the gardner or Cooke, and willing to doe those things that were most contrarie to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. In the end he would thanke them on his knees, that they vouchsafed to call him to worke, and make him partaker of their labours, He was so obedient at the becke of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, that there was nothing so hard, which he would not doe with a cheerefull heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. He gaue as much reuerence to Priests, as if he had seene some of the holie Apostles or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176965:258"/> Confessours present. To his fellowes and equals, he was so mild, and so louing, as if he had beene their seruant. In the Refectorie he sate at the table so inwardly recollected, that his meate &amp; drinke was tedious to him, had he not beene compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by necessitie and common obedience, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect him selfe thereto: and this was not to be marueiled at in him, when as he had learned to subdue the rage and furie of gourmandise long since.</p>
                     <p>After his refection the dishes being washed, hauing said the office of our blessed Ladie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a round about the garden, all the rest of the time euen till euening, if there were nothing to be done in common, he retired himselfe to a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie place, and did then goe to his cel. Hither he did inuite sweete Iesus, sometimes with deep groanes, sometimes with amorous sighs, and was wont to commend all the necessities of Christs vniuersall familie, to his holie conduct. The last day will reueale what sacred sweete dainties he tasted, in communing there with his beloued one. For whereas he knewe that bodily exercise is profitable to litle, but pietie is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all thinges, according to the counsaile of the same Apostle, he did pursue the better gifts and did diligentlie followe the more excellent way shewed to him, especially in most perfect quitting of all proprietie, yea of things most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, in a most simple stripping of himselfe from all things created, in a most profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176965:259"/> of all representations though most noble, out of the closet of his soule, that he might attaine to a most inward vnion with God, by an actuall and most feruent charitie, which as he had learned by the Apostle, doth neuer fal away. But the other gifts (as S. Thomas saith) because they haue imperfection, are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, according to that. When that shall come that is perfect, that shall be made voide that is in part, that is that which is imperfect. For a part doth implie imperfection, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Doctour teacheth. In keeping silence he was so seuere, that in time of common recreation (which is permitted but one or two dayes, to the end the obligations of fasting might be the better performed) he seemed to force him selfe to be merrie a litle with his companie, to auoide the note of singularitie. Neither is it for nought that the raines are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sometimes to yong men. For by this the elder will iudge much, of the rigour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacitie, or slownesse and heauinesse of yong mens spirits.</p>

                     <head>Of his outward composition and feruour in prayer. THE XVIII. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>WHen he was sent out into the citie, either to visite the sicke, or to demand almes, or vpon anie other cause, his countenance and behauiour was so modest, and indeed so mortified, that euen by his outward presence, he did moue the hearts of sinners, and did checke the vanitie of youth, and sometimes wholie subdue it. For in this kind, a Lay brother may doe the dutie of a preacher. For we reade in our Chronicles, that S. Francis saide so to his brother. Let vs goe to preach (saith he) through the streets of the citie. They went silently through one or two streets bare footed, though the cold was verie great, and returning home, they found a wild licentious man at the gate of their Conuent, humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing to be admitted to their order; whom the S. foresawe no doubt in spirit, was to be gained by such meanes. Let no man therefore meruaile if God doth ordaine diuerse kinds of orders and diuerse habits, and cause their manners to be composed in distinct and diuerse decencie. For by these as by diuerse nets, he taketh worldly mē. Let them therefore creepe vnder some whole &amp; perfect net, if they desire with S. Antonie, to auoid
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176965:260"/> the daungers of this world. In the deuine office and psalmodie, if anie man had well obserued, this brothers composed and serene countenance, and the posture of his bodie bolt vpright, the cheerefulnesse of his voice, his vnmoueable eyes, the attention of his heart, the teares often tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe by reason of internall gust, he would haue said he had seene an Angel rapt vp in spirit into the heauenly quire.</p>
                     <p>In the time of his mentall prayer, the habit whereof he got with much labour and exercise, he enioyed sometimes such inward aboundance of the ioy of spirit, that it streamed forth with euident tokens, so that his bodie was pertaker or it. And when wicked tentations or anie heauy &amp; and dull wearisomnesse did take hold of him, he did shake them off with such force, that he hath beene seene in that combate to encounter the deuill, and to foile him, as also to raise vpp his dull iadish flesh, by applying his bare feete to the cold pauement, and to gall his backe with chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of iron, which kind of weapons are vsed in such cases by religious champions. Finally pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after God, and cleauing wholie to him, with all quicknesse of memorie, sharpnesse of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, preparation and readinesse of will, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of heart, with intention of all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and extension of his handes, he did seeme to enforce God after a manner, that in the retraict and bottome of his soule, he might be held fast with the sweete embracements of his beloued,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176965:260"/> and in these might flowe and runne from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so consequently wholie flowe into the Ocean of his infinite bountie, and in these flouds of loue, might become one with God and with him, by an absolute melting and resolution of all his powers, and an annihilation into God and his holie will and pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Who is able to expresse what God speaketh in that heart, in which the peace of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, which passeth all vnderstanding, and what God worketh in that soule which is transfused into God, and God into it, by the vnspeakeable enioying of his goodnesse? But the sensuall man doth not perceiue those things, which are of the spirit of God, for these things seeme follie to him. Hence Saint Paul affirmeth, that he could not speake to the Corinthians as to spirituall men, but as to carnal, concerning that wisedome whereof he spake confidently among perfect mē, who haue the sense of Christ. It is to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we are now fallen into those times, as the Seraphicall Doctour S. Bonauenture saith, in his first booke of perfection of religion c. 18. in which there is scarce anie mention of spirituall delights, which doe so farre exceed all worldly delights, as honey doth dung, yea among those who seeme to themselues, to be deepe in religion, the sweete drunkennesse of such desires is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med follie, and reputed as an abomination, and those which are spirituall, are iudged to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the deuill, and are called heretiques.</p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:176965:261"/>
                     <p>All the spiritualitie of manie, consisteth rather in questioning and disputing, who as Saint Paul saith, doe alwayes learne, and neuer come to the knowledge of truth. And in an other place, they languish about questions and strife of words. Curious men would not occupie their spirits about these things, if they would choose rather with Saint Bernard, to feele compunction, then to knowe the definition of it. For we see these manner of questions are handled, whether the supereminent vnion be anie thing else but habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and actuall charitie, whether this vnion be such that it may truly be said, that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh God, and God man, so that all actions that are in this man, are not mans but only Gods actions, yea euerie passion and omission is of God only, and so in all a man is merely passiue not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue in respect of God, of whom he is taught, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, and immediatly subiect. These que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions I say would neuer much trouble mens cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie, if they could keepe the order prescribed by the Prophet: Tast and see, that by the tast thereof they might iudge what it is. For no man knoweth but he which tasteth. If that they might well tast this, they would purge the palate of the soule from all inordination, both of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will, and would labour to depriue both faculties of all that is not God, which if they would doe, they should no doubt finde by experience, that the foresaid vnion, doth import somewhat else beyond actuall charitie, when as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176965:261"/> by it man doth so perfectly passe into God, and is no more himselfe, but he giueth place to God, so that he may not only say with the spouse: My soule was melted as soone as my beloued spake, but with the royall Prophete he may say. I was brought to nothing, and not knowing. He shall also finde according to that of S. Paul. He which adhereth to God is one spirit, &amp; that by the same vnion, in a far more excellent manner then by the ordinarie Acts of charitie, that man beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth God.</p>
                     <p>The Psalme saith. I haue said ye are Gods. And S. Augustine in his second Treatise vpon the first epistle of S. Iohn saith. If thou louest God thou art God. And S. Hierome vpon the psalm. 114. according to the Hebrewes v. 5. As long as we are men, we doe erre and lye, but when we shall be made God, we cease to lye. And immediatly after he saith. If therefore anie man become holie, he is made God, and when he shall be made God, he ceaseth to be man, and lyeth no more. And Clement Alexandria saith. Man which is brought to be impatible is made God, yea God himselfe in some manner is made, that man himselfe, to witt, not the old man, but the newe who is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to God in holinesse and iustice of truth. So that of Saint Paul is verified. When al things shall be subiected to him, then shall the sonne be subiect to him who hath subiected all things to himselfe, that God may be all in all. And then there is no Gentile and Iewe, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176965:262"/> and prepuce, barbarous &amp; Scythian, bond &amp; free, but all and in all Christ. For it is certaine out of S. Pauls words, that while the newe man is produced in vs, and while we put on the newe man, we put on Christ.</p>
                     <p>This once being, they would finde (I say) that all actions and passions in man assumpt to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vnion, not to be of man, but of God alone, for asmuch as he is the principall cause, either ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or finall, of all actions and passions which are in such a man. Whereupon S. Paul saith. Nowe do not I liue, but Christ liueth in me. So in most things man is merely passiue to God, while he is in this vnion. And manie Doctours doe teach, that he is merely passiue, not only in the receiuing of habituall gifts, but some actuall. So this vnion which the mysticall writers terme supereminent, is only from God, according to that Psalm. 38. Our assumption is our Lords, and our holie king of Israel; of which vnion Ricardus speaking of the 4. degrees of violent charitie, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Saint Bonauenture; As (saith he) the first degree doth wound him that is affected, so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond doth bind him being wounded, the third doth so implicate his action, that the minde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend anie thing, but where the enclining of Gods will doth drawe him and moue him, and so they who haue attained to this degree, doe nothing of their proper will, leane nothing to their owne disposition, but commital to God.</p>
                     <p>But whether haue the embracements of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176965:262"/> beloued transported me, that I haue made this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression for my historie.

                     <head>What course he kept in his studies, and with how manie mortifications he was exercised. THE XIX. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>HE did neuer so follow his studies, that he would intermitt the time of prayer, or the exercise of the Communitie, much lesse neglect them. For he knewe, that he was so to attend the profit of others, and the gaine of soules, that without neglecting himselfe, he did not endom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage his owne soule. Therefore whether he were to apply himselfe to reading, or to his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he was wont to vse prayer before, and to direct a streight simple holy intention to his sweete Iesus, and also to imploy the helpe and intercession of the blessed mother of God, and of his patron Saint Frauncis. All which good exercises and holie customes when he was made priest, he neglected not, but rather being made a superiour against his will (as we will shewe hereafter) he encreased them, and all other good vertues, bearing both the loue and feare of God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:176965:263"/> fastned in his heart. Hence it came to passe, that he lay prostrate with his face on the ground verie often, when he was both to enter into the Church, and to goe forth, deuoutlye kissing the earth with bended knees. So did he teach others by his example, to adore him that reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in heauen, &amp; humbled himselfe for vs euen to the earth.</p>
                     <p>He did frequent the holie communion, with exceeding greate ardour and compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of heart, allwayes making before a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall confession, and cleaning himselfe diligently from the least corruption of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which he strictlie examined. Thus he did (I say) with such deuotion, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being excited by his feruour, did take fresh courage to runne all to the wished goale. When he was young, he did serue the Priest with so much reuerence (for he had virginall beautie and grace allso in his countenance, which did kindle deuotion in those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him) that manie who were without the Chancel, were as much moued with his deuout manner of seruice, as with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious office of him that sacrificed. And by such deuout attendance at the Altar, Saint Bonauenture confesseth, that he obtained of God great treasure of graces. To speake of all gifts and prerogatiues of vertues, it would be too long a discourse.</p>

                     <p>Marke I pray you, and I will declare vnto you, with how happie successe he proceeded, not if we speake accordinge to carnall sense, but according to the spiritt, which mounteth to God by cliftie and hard wayes, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against the flesh, as the Apostle saith. These thinges which thou didest both priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and publiquelie (o brother Archangell) were approued of all to be good and praise-worthie, not false and farded. But how? If surely for praise and applause due to thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, thou hadst bitter mockings, reproches, scorne-full derisions, chidings, reproofes, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words pearcing euen to the heart, is not this a worthie and condigne reward? No: it is too small. Let vs proceede on. Let vs see what discipline thou wert commaunded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on thy selfe, how manie crosses thou wast made to drawe with thy tongue vpon the pauement, how often a wooden gag was putt in thy mouth, and for what cause, I pray you? Peraduenture you were too full of pratling and babling? No, but least vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie might creepe vpon you, because you kept silence better then others. But why is a dish-clout like a vaile bound about your head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes? They deserue it, who doe not shut their wandering eyes, and doe not keepe them from vaine aspects. Although thou chast chasteyes (for the disciple is not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176965:264"/> aboue his maister) yet art thou to be vexed in them. Sometime thy superiour or thy elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, standeth by thee which setteth vpon thee as it were with iniurious words, and as though he were offended, reuileth thee and proclaimeth thee wholy vnprofitable for religion, putteth thee to confusion of face before all, and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terh that thou doest all things but fainedly and dissemblingly. If thou doest desire to fast, thou art commanded to eate and deuoure so much, that thou maist be called a glutton and a rauenner. If thou doest intend to refresh thy selfe, and feede liberally vpon some solemne day, presently thou shalt be commaunded to fold vp thy napkin. When nature is oppressed with heauinesse, thou must presentlie be commaunded to be merrie &amp; cherefull: and if thou reioycest and cheerest vpp thy selfe at their commaundement, loe straight-wayes a suddaine whirle-winde riseth, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thee from that state of minde. Doest thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the health of bodie? Tribulations and sorrowes growe vpon thee some other way, and beset thee on euerie side. That I may confesse a truth, I see the holy ghost, not only directing both the words and actions, both of the maister and superiours, but also inciting, so that nothing is wanting for the proofe and tryal of the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours of Christ, why they may not iustly vse those words of the Prophete. Thou hast laid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations on our backe, and thou hast sett men vpon our heads.</p>

                     <p>Neither is it needfull here, to hire a scolding queane to vexe his hart, and braine, with crying and scolding at him, that by such exercise he might at length learne patience, for surely the Cappucins giue occasion of such exercise to the yonger sort, verie plentifully and without cause for Christs sake, that by their sufferings, they may learne patience, by the example of Christ. Clima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus saith. If thou wilt clime to the highest top of vertue, seeke a guide &amp; a maister, whose name is hard and rough, vnder whom thou maist conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue drinking and digesting dayly chidings, and reproche full mockings, as hony and milke: yea thinke thou hast sustained great dommage that day, when thou hast had no such afflictions. For as trees which are shaken by great windes, haue deepe rootes: so they who liue in obedience and are diuersly proued, possesse vnshaken and valiant hearts. But peraduenture these seeme to be light and slight matters to the worldly man, yea seeme absurd and ridiculous? Notwithstanding as he who hath gotten health by some bitter potion, doth not iudge that it is therefore to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because it is made of some vile and common herbs: so must we thinke of these trialls, which seeme to be despiceable. A yong fresh nouice co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming first to the magazin of his instructour, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to what end all those instruments are, till he learne to practise them.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of my conuersion, I was much troubled at such kind of exercises, in so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176965:265"/> much that I could hardly forbeare to breake out into these words some-what malepertly. I came hither to this end hoping for quietnesse &amp; peace, after manie turmoiles in the world, and here I find continuall crying. The Superiour is both the accuser, and the iudge. The accused person can haue no licence to answere for himselfe, neither can the innocent be heard. All that he doth is condemned. His diligence is punished as well as his negligence. While we are to take our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall refection, we heare litle but raylings and cryes. Besides there are manie seuerities, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines. I had rather goe supperlesse to bed, then come forth to the Cappucins chapter. I desire therefore this only fauour, that I may eate my portion in my cel, as I did for eight dayes before I was cloathed. It seemed to me a verie good proposition, but God knoweth and I, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion followed, to whom I giue infinite than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. For happie is he, as Climacus saith, who thinketh himselfe worthie at all howres of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie and vilifying, and who being charged with reproches, holdeth his peace here, for he shall reioice there, and shall be made equall to the Angells.</p>
                     <p>See the mercie of God, he doth not only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sinners in religion, but he maketh them rich in good workes, and by this methode encreaseth their crowne. For by how much the labour is greater, the crowne and reward is greater. And so they bring forth fruicts worthie of repentance,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176965:265"/> that they may gett so much greater gaine of good workes by pennance, by how much they haue runne in greater arrerage through sinne, as Saint Gregorie saith. The Prophete fore-seeing this said. We haue reioyced for the dayes wherein thou didst humble vs, &amp; for the yeares in which we sawe euill, that is affliction. And againe. How manie tribulations hast thou shewed to me both manie and euill, but thou being conuerted hast quickned me. If vexation doth afford this to the nocent, what doth it to the innocent? O noble Archangel, what profit hast thou receiued out of so manie vexations? Great indulgence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is due to voluntarie pennance, but much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the patient suffering of those pennances and vexations, which are inflicted by others.</p>
                     <p>We reade in the liues of the fathers, that a yong monke, by nation a Graecian, hauing too slipperie a tongue, did often manifest the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie of his heart before his brethren, whom the Abbot committed to be chastised and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the seniours. They treated him so, that they made him often failing into this frailtie, goe without dinner and supper to bed. He being dead appeared to the Abbot, and confessed, that those kinde of vexations, caused him to obtaine a heauenly crowne, without feeling anie paines of purgatorie. Therefore we cannot but render this praise to thee (o Archangel) who as a yong simple lambe, wast allwayes meeke and chearefull. Thou wast neuer seene to depart when thou
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176965:266"/> hadst done thy pennance, but that humbly on thy knees, thou didst blesse God, as thy exerciser and singular benefactour, who is wise and will keepe his, that they may vnderstand the wages of our Lord, and his hidden wayes. These things be vnsauorie to the wise of this world, they seeme follies to those that are falsely great, yet are they ministred to the litle ones, who profes the Gospel. Out of these is tasted the hidden Manna, by which they are pacified in the palate of the heart, being pacified obtaine the heritage of the sonnes and freinds of God. Which being obtained, what can be kept from his inward and secrete freinds? He speaketh to them thus Ioan. 15. Now I will not call you seruants, but freinds. For all that I haue heard of my father, I haue made knowne to you; To this honour was Archangel exalted.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceede to the rest of his life, which though I desire to make perfect, and to omitt nothing of importance, yet I am not able to performe it, because he changed often his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or places of dwelling, by order from our Superiours, and I haue not had commoditie to conferre with the religious of all those places with whom he conuersed, nor I haue wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, which either I sawe not my selfe, or did not vnderstand by verie good and most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible relation of other religious, whom I haue alwayes obserued to be verie sparing in reuealing the vertuous qualities of their brethren, as not making so much esteeme of them. So happily the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176965:266"/> propre and inbred complacencie of men is quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when they are not affected with such vaine glorie.</p>

                     <p>WE haue recited before one cause why Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, by order of his Superiour, came not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of his life from Bruges to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. Nowe we will relate an other occasion, which will make way for the prosecution of the rest of the narration. In this famous citie of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, there is a Conuent of Cappucins, though vnholesomely situated, yet most conuenient for a solitary quiet life, in which Archangel was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his superiours, so that he might the rather giue himselfe to pious exercises and prayers, which were his true delights before he was a Preacher. While he thought all things were most quiet, a sudden disturbation of his rest arriued. The Guardian had notice from some citizens, that certaine Scotish-men who seemed to be men of resolution and of hardie attempts, did walke about the Conuent, tooke a viewe of all, and obserued the countenance of the yonger brethren (though they knewe it not, for the yonger men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176965:267"/> doe not of sett purpose cast vp their eyes) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they gaue occasion to suspect, that they bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring extraordinarie affection to Archangels father (as grieuing that he should be depriued of his onlie sonne and heire) conceiuing also that their countrie sustained a great losse herein, would attempt to take him by force and carrie him away. For auoiding this inconuenience he was sooner sent away thence to Lisle, which was a place designed for studies, where he passed his course in Philosophie, and afterward in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie.</p>
                     <p>The same attempt was enterprised by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Scotish men at Antwerpe before; The Cappucins house being close to the gate which is toward Holland, gaue them occasion to thinke, that they might doe that which they designed. We knowe it also to be true, that certaine Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish men, both in these parts and in Scotland, made their complaints in the presence of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Catholique Princes, that brother Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel was a Cappucin, alleaging manie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for the defence of their countrie and the faith, that he should be persuaded to beare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes as Fa. Archangel the Cappucin Duke of Ioyeuse did in the like exigent. But God did not permitt this, for that what he did not in that kinde, being an vnexercised soldiour, he performed more effectually by prayers and teares.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding least the profit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176965:267"/> wealth seeme to be neglected, by the losse of this noble gentleman, let vs sett downe what God wrought by other noble instruments. For at the same time, God stirred vp the heart and strength of his noble vnkle, who spent his life for the Catholique faith in defending his countrie; Who with a small number of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique soldiours, like an other Iudas Macchabaeus, who trusted not in his number of soldiours but in God, put to flight valiantly his enemies which were heretiques: which victories he gained of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in diuerse skirmishes, and in his last conflict with them he slewe manie, though his enemies were farre greater in number, and forced manie to yeeld themselues, till at the length the horse of this warlike Prince stroken with a disease, stood as stiffe as a stake, and would not moue one foote. For the horse was enchaunted by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine maide-seruant of a neighbour woman of this noble warriour. The enemie perceiuing his strange stifnesse of horse flying before him, ioyned their forces againe, and tooke courage vpon this aduantage beeing offered to them, by the bewitching of his horse. Whereupon the Catholique soldiours were also much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and wanting their Generall, both to encourage and lead them, lost their liues and the battle. Their Gouernour was taken by the enemie, and without anie feeling of humanitie, they cruelly butchered him, cutting off his eares, his nose, his eyelids, and other parts of his bodie,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176965:268"/> left him halfe aliue in the field, when the battle was fought. Not vnhappie to him, if there be due respect had of the gaine of his soule, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gaue vp the ghost, taking a golden key out of his bosome, with his hand which was halfe cut off, deliuered it to a friend of his, with these worde which he spake imperfectly. Here is the key of my chappel and oratorie, which was my great solace. Deliuer this to my most deare brother, and commend me to him, and require him that in that holie place he call for helpe from God, and prepare himselfe to die nobly for the truth.</p>
                     <p>This noble leader in this iust warre was the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Huntley, one of the brethren which were slaine for the defence of religion, and vnkle to Archangel, whom he did assist alwaies by feruent prayer and voluntarie affliction of himselfe, so that both folowed their vocation in a diuerse kind; the one in spirit, the other in power and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: the one in silence and quiet retraict of minde speaking to God, the other in warlike acts and valiant interprises: Therfore we are not to thinke, that the common good was hindred by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Archangel, but rather promoted after a more effectuall manner. Neither was it destitute of defenders, by occasion of his entrie into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for God prouided sufficient defendours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time in which he hath determined to make manifest his iustice in the Scotish nation, and the bordering countreis. But you will say.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:176965:268"/> How hath God prouided, seeing that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all the Catholiques were ouerthrowne by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the losse of this battaile, wherein the Gordons were subdued? But we must not iudge of the vnhappinesse of the battle of Catholiques by such ouerthrowes, as though it were a newe and strang thing, that Christians, euen by dying haue carried the victorie, and haue taken the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen by such violence, and so haue quelled their einmies. For we find by experience, that such bloodshed, doth yeeld great encrease, &amp; doth bring forth ten fold more noble &amp; heroical persons in their place, to fight against the enemie. So after the death of Iudas Macchabeus, whom the Iewes did much lament, as though in humane consideration they were wholy ouerthrowne, yet it happened that his death was more precious then his life, and stirred vp manie to die valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, so that the shedding of his blood, did not strike a terrour, but gaue courage to manie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Israel, succeeding one after an other.</p>

                     <p>I Will not let passe here a strange accident, which father Henrie of Aldenrade, the Gardian of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176965:269"/> the Cappucins at Antwerpe, and reader of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, affirmed for a truth to me and others, who were vnder his gouerment, when this brother Archangel, and this father remained in the same Conuent at Lisle together, where the yong bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren followed their studies vnder a reader de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for them. It happened that two Scotish yong men came thither, one was of the ranke of Counts, the other of Barons, and both of them neare to him in kindred, but the Count was nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Both of them came to see brother Archangel whom they lōged much to see, hauing heard that he was in those parts, and so hauing obtained safe conduct, at length they found him at Lisle, where they came to the Cappucins Conuent, &amp; enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after a Scotish man, were brought to him, whom they desired to see and conferre withall.</p>
                     <p>The Count as soone as he sawe brother Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel, fel back ward, being much astonished &amp; troubled both in bodie and minde. Brother Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel lifting him vp, asked of what religion he was? when he answered a Protestant. Then said Archangel you are abominable to vs. For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans had not cōmerce or fellowship with the Iewes: purposing to vrge him with a sharper que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, he being much moued thereat was by litle and litle instructed more fully in the Catholique faith, &amp; was admitted to the rites of Catholiques, and baptised vnder cōdition with manie ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, &amp; reconciled to the Church. Who doth not wonder at this? Who can search the secret consail
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176965:269"/> of God? Two yong men made a long iourney to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both of them came to the Cappucins gate to geather, the one is receiued, the other reiected. The eternal word of truth hath said it should be so. God be mercifull to the other, that the feareful forsaking be not fulfilled in him.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer father Henrie did affirme, that B. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel was of inuincible patience in sicknesse &amp; all aduersities, and inwardly had the spiritual ioye of continuall holie meditation and contēplation. No mā knoweth these ioyes, but those who haue them. Heare the secrete of an auctour illuminated, what fruict there is by this cōmerce with a soule wel disposed. He maketh often visits to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, and hath sweete conference with him, whereupō much peace followeth &amp; familiarity to be much wōdered at, but not able to be expressed.</p>
                     <p>When father Archangell at his fit time was made Gardian of Brussels by the cōmaund of his superiour, he refused it with exceeding humilitie and bash-fulnesse. For such a charge, was indeed verie contrarie to his natural disposition and bash-fulnesse, which made him wish that he might passe his time in rest and vnknowen. He laboured to excuse himselfe as wel as he could, signifying that he was too yong for such a charge, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that he wanted experience, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in such a superiour. But he could not resist Gods ordination, yet he obtained that the yeare following he might be in some more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and retired place then neare the Court,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176965:270"/> if he were to sustaine the like charge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went to Teneramund, where a Conuent was built by the almes of Spanish soldiours in a most conuenient place, which was walled in with a pleasant garden, and a most cleare riuer, which did ebbe and flowe twice a day, and had trees and herbes verie necessarie for our souste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. To conclude, It was a place verie fit for a religious retraict, and for silence and meditation, in which Fa. Archangell was much delighted. There was also an other brooke which running through the midle of this situation (vpon the bridge of which brooke we shall vnderstand that fa. Archangel ended his life the day ordained by God) which doth separate one garden from an other, which further garden was bought by the most noble Prince Albert, and giuen in almes to the religious: for he thought that the garden ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the house before, was not large enough for their necessaries, when he was pleased to viewe the monasterie of Teneramund, and vouchsafed by his personal presence to visit the religious, and to honour them much with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding humanitie, and verie rare in those of his ranke.</p>
                     <p>The reuerend fa. Clement a Flemming, late Guardian of the Cappucins at Brussels, and the preseruer of this Prouince, who in the yeare 1600. when all the state began to totter in the west part of Flanders, by reason of an ouerthrowe that the heretiques had giuen the Catholiques,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176965:270"/> did greate seruice in encouraging the people of Bruges, being much afraid and amated vpon the victorie of the enemie. This fa. I say told me, that he earnestly persuaded Archangel, whose inward freind he was, that he would take some good occasion to write verie respectfully and dutifully, yet as forcibly and mouingly by good reasons as he could, to the most potent and great Prince Iames, then kinge of Scotland, to whom he was ioyned in nearenesse of blood, and whom he had attended often in his youth, both in the Court and abroad in his hunting and sport. Which he did at his request, and sent him a letter written in the mother tongue, wherein he shewed how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie the profession of the Catholique faith was vnto saluation, and in it he did discouer the vanitie of Protestants, and the odious vnsauori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Puritans. The king at the same time pretending the crowne of England, which was fallen to him by the death of Elizabeth, neuer made him anie reply. And Archangel did earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie intreate this father, that he would not reueale it, least by this meanes he might make knowne his noble birth, which he did desire to keepe secrete.</p>
                     <p>Fa. Archangell finding great inward gust and contentment, in the disesteeming and despising of himselfe, in his pouertie, in his long banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the want of carnal comfort, and absence of kindred: for the word of Christ cannot deceiue vs, who hath promised one hundred fold recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176965:271"/> to such, not only in the life to come, but in this present, did labour out of meere and most abundant loue and charitie, to make the afflicted soule of his mother partaker of this spirituall banquet, and he vseth manie meanes to this end, by which the wisedome of God doth aptly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the good of his elect. He was mindfull how his elder brother had lately liued in banishment, and entred the religion of the Cappucins, and being a religious man, how he had dealt with him by letters and other entercourse, for to be perfectly conuerted to God, and how he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to an auersion from all vaine comforts of what creatures so euer. Which that he might effectually doe, he counsailed him to hasten his flight and departure from his countrie, that soe he might couragiously at first passe by rough waies, to come to the plaine and euen way, and to a firme and strong adhesion and vnion with the first fountaine and beginning, full of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and contentment.</p>
                     <p>He was also mindfull, how by the prouident and faithfull care of his mother he had beene la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely deliuered, God protecting him from the wicked snares, from the words of lying, from the vniust and defiled tongue, from the lips of those that worke lies, from the hands of those that sought his soule, and from the sharpe word of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgement. And therefore his soule with all its forces praised God, and being moued to the vertue of Gratitude, he thought to requite it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176965:271"/> towards his mother, and to folow the example of his brother, whom he had found to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him in spirit, and spirituall proceedings. And that he might begin to giue spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his deare mother, who liued as a desolate matron in her countrie, he wrote confortable letters to her, and exhorted her to seeke after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of vertue, to which she was verie well prepared and disposed, hauing tasted so much of the bitter cup of affliction, and among other things, he perswaded her to folow both her son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in abandoning hir countrie.</p>
                     <p>But how can this be done, where are so manie great persons of her kindred, who being iealous of her, watch ouer her? Godwill assist her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour desires, and will heare the prayer of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious sonne. Against God, neither strength, nor craft, can preuaile. Let vs therefore behold the prosperous arriuall of this matron. The day it not farre off when she will be here, attended only with one handmaid, bringing a few Iewels and precious stones with her. It is reported that she is arriued in these parts, not without some crosse accidents, let her not feare to come hither with the leaue of our noble Princes, to make a happie entrie into this land, renowned for wealth and armes, not inferiour to the most flourishing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Here doth her only sonne expect her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with much longing affection of a dutifull childe.</p>

At the first they embraced one the other, and were not able to speake for exceeding ioy. At the length, after this rauishment of ioy, they conferred together, and when they had ended their conference, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men came to reioice with this noble Dame for her safe arriuall, and receiued her with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour possible they could doe her, and assisted her being exiled for Christs sake, and cheared her with good counsaile and comfort, and shewed all tokens of exceeding charitie towards her. How ioyfull was she, to see her sonne become of a Protestant, an earnest enemie of al brangling sects, and of an ignorant yong man, who had learned no good letters, to become learned without his fathers expences, and to haue changed his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie domaines and territories, for royall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? These thinges made her forget all sorrowe past, being as it were absorpt in ioyfull praise of the Creatour.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:176965:272"/>
                     <p>Before this meeting, as soone as she came into this countrie (kindled with fire of deuotion) she went to the first church which she sawe, in which with great reuerence on her knees, she adored the blessed Sacrament, shedding many teares for ioy. There shee powred forth her heart, in thāksgiuing and other meditations, and continued in them with great feruour and spiritual gust. In the meane while, her handmaide (of a good familie) who attended her faithfully in this voyage and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being as yet tainted with the infection of the religion of the countrie, and to speake the truth, brought vp in heresie, and shortly to be gained to the church, was curious to behold all thinges in the church, and obserued all her ladies behauiour and her actions: who when she did bowe her selfe, and did reuerence after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Catholiques to the Images of Saincts, she looked about her to see if there were anie persons of qualitie, to whom her Ladie did this reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.

As she looked about her on euerie side at length she came neare to S. Christopher, at the sight of whom she was stroken suddenly with feare, and made him a verie lowe reuerence, and presently made as much speed as she could to be gone our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176965:273"/> of the church, and there waited for her Ladie. To whom when she asked her why she made such hast to be gone, she said. I was afraid least that great man which I sawe, would haue stroke me with the great staffe on which he leaneth. Her Ladie laught at the stupid simplicitie of this yong wench, who as I said before, was rather brought vp in heresie, then infected with it.</p>
                     <p>When this yong maide did after enquire of Fa. Archangel, what was meant by that giant like Image of St. Christopher, wading through the sea, leaning on a staffe, and carrying a yong child vpon his backe, he freindly instructed her in this manner. Although it be true, that St. Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was of a goodly great stature, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding because the forme of his soule was much more eminent, and that his spirituall stature was eminent among those who liued at the same time, it came to passe that painters and grauers, who first drewe his Image, did rather seeke to expresse his eminent gifts of vertue wherein he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others, and did rather represent his noble mind, then the outward lineaments of his bodie. For the art of grauing and caruing, doth often expresse by certaine visible signes and simbols, that which is spirituall and inuisible, though in progresse of time this simbole occasioneth the fiction of manie fables, among ignorant persons, as this particularly of St. Christopher. Therefore his greatnesse, signifieth the greatnesse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his mind, in ouercoming brutish vices, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:176965:273"/> leaning on the vertue of Christs crosse, which is figured by his staffe, he passed confidently through the maine sea of this world, which swelleth with the billowes of tentations, and so merited to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the child Iesus vpon his shoulders, not in his bodie, but in his minde, not outwardly, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and spiritually. He shewed the effects of his loue and zeale, in preaching Christ, so that he conuerted eight and fortie thousand soules to Christ, and so he bore Christ in his bodie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the speech of the Apostle, they exhibited Christ in forme of a child, because Christ is but a litle one in those that are newly conuerted to the faith, though he be the gouernour of the whole world, &amp; therefore beareth in his hand the figure of the world. He being preuented with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of this child, did subdue all his enemies. This benediction is represented by two fingers of this sweete and world-bearing child (the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world) which are lifted vp to giue a blessing. So spirituall arte doth present that to out vnderstanding, vnder sensible simboles &amp; signes, which is not displeasing to God and his Saints. For God appearing to the Prophetes, represented himselfe by diuerse visible signes, both in the old and new testament. This maide gaue often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of mirth when they spake of this matter: but afterward being conuerted, she gaue God thankes for her deliuerance from darkenesse, all things cooperating to the elect for their good.</p>

                     <head>Fa. Archangel is placed at Antwerpe. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther folowed him thither, and what things happened to him there. THE XXIII. CHAPTER.</head>
                     <p>FA. Archangel hauing finished his course of studies at Isle in Flanders, he was sent by his Superiour to Antwerpe, that he might be there Vicar of the Conuent. For one cannot sustaine the whole charge alone. But where shall the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaine? She will folow without doubt her sonne, if opportunitie permitt that she may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the nourishment of mind and spirit from him, whom she had begotten in bodie, and to whom she had so louingly ministred the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of her mothers milke. Goe on confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently (o matron) noble in pietie, in blood, and in thy children, folow thy sonne to Antwerpe: The benignitie of the citizens doth inuite thee, yea the nobles are as fauourable and courteous to strangers, as the citizens. Therefore feare not, but thou shall be welcome to them, and to vs who are your sonnes brethren.</p>
                     <p>As soone as Fa. Guardian of this Conuent at Antwerpe, heard that the mother of his Vicar was neare at hand, he prepareth himselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this exiled matron of Iesus Christ, and to giue her all manner of good comfort. This Fa.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176965:274"/> Guardians name was Cornelius of Aecanate, well knowne to the Italians, to the Loue-countrie men, to the Switzers, to the Germans, a man all fierie in performance of brotherly charitie, who for the loue of his Prince and of this countrie, went with an vndaunted courage to those sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious souldiours, who had a fewe yeares before attempted the Castle of Hoostrate, and with whom he so dealt, that by his words of zeale and feruour, he pacified them and made them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt themselues to their Prince. At whose speech they were much inwardly moued, but the oath they had giuen to their fellowes being absent, held them in the rebellion; yet did they shewe all good respect to this religious man, by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying him with all necessaries, and bringinge him safely on his way. This good Father ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue preuailed with them as he had done before with those seditious soldiours at Wattem, whom he kept by his sermons and exhortations in so good militarie discipline, as if he had beene their true spirituall father chosen by them. In time he so wonne their hearts that they became most peaceable, in so much that it was said, that this cōmotion was not vnprofitable to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and common weale, by reason of these good seruices which the soldiours did at that time. This good father was made afterward generall Commissarie of the Prouinces of Colen, which charge how wel he performed it is, needlesse now to recount.</p>

                     <p>But to returne to our purpose. This reuerend father, commaunded all that were vnder his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, that they should doe all good seruices for the comfortt of this noble matron, and he himselfe gaue so good example of all candour and pietie, that he did helpe her by all poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ble meanes, and by a faithfull interpretour, did make a most confortable exhortation to her, being now in affliction and exile for Christes sake, so that this second meeting with her sonne, seemed to be more solemne then the first. She was so affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at this, that for verie dilatation of heart, she seemed to haue forgotten her husbād, her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all her miseries past, being readie as an other Elizabeth, to gaine her liuing by her owne hands, and the arte of her needle or distaffe: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did she scorne when she liued at Antwerpe (being commended to rich men) to take Almes: and when a marchant sent a peece of gold to her by his seruant, she receiued it with her owne hands, so humbly that manie wondered at this debasing of her selfe, who refused not to take an almes like a poore begger. At length the most element Princes hauing commiseration on her, gaue her an honest yearly pension of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique king for her maintainance: who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for her greater comfort, followed her sonne wheresoeuer he was sent by his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in this Prouince.</p>
                     <p>Here I must not passe in silence, what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Madame Margarete being at Antwerpe,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:176965:275"/> who vpon Ember Wednesday in Aduent, was vp early to heare a solemne Masse, which was wont to be celebrated euerie yeare in some great churches, in memorie of the ioyful tidings, which were brought from heauen to mankind, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Bless. Virgin. In which morning sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, manie lights burning in a place made to this end, where there was also a liuely represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of persons, sitting to expresse the matter, and a doue as it were falling from heauen, in the midst of this most radiant and bright light, that by these outward ceremonies, the mindes and eyes of the beholders, might be lifted vpp with deuotion, in signe of a ioyfull and reuerend me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of so great a benefit, done to vs by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnesse of God. At this solemnitie (I say) this woman was present, shewing much ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and exultation of heart, not accustomed to see anie such thing in her countrie. She being wholy good her selfe, and suspecting no euill, thought that in such an assembly, there were none who would seeke that which was none of their owne in others purses. But when her purse was emptie (for as yet she had receiued nothing of her pension graunted to her) and when the theeues could find no monie about her, they lay in waite for her mantle or short cloake, which was lined after the manner of the countrie with white skins, be-speckled with blacke, which was taken from her shoulders in the midst of the presse before she was aware,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:176965:276"/> and they which tooke it, went away cleanly with it without being knowne. When she perceiued that she had lost it, she was so farre from complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this misfortune, that she rather smiled at it as an other S. Elizabeth.</p>
                     <p>Her sonne and his brethren the Cappucins, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing compassion on her, commended her neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities to God and to the B. Virgin, and it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the same euening, these sacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being inwardly pricked in cōscience, brought backe this cloake to the matron, &amp; instāly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe thēselues, that they might not be knowne. Which kind of restitution from these sort of men, was much wondered at. Therefore S. Peter doth well exhort vs, to trust in God and not in our selues, because he hath care of vs. Why saith Christ are ye carefull of your garments? God giueth to all aboundantly and vpbraideth none, and that both in spiritual things appertaining to the soule, and in corporall things necessarie for our life. For all things come from him, and God hath no small care of his seruants, as it is euident in this exiled woman the Ladie Margarete, and in her hand-maide, to whom he gaue abilitie to learne the Dutch tongue immediatly after her conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that she might be fit to be receiued among the religious sisters of S. Brigit, and gaue her such grace and courage to enter into this state of life, that no man could dissuade her from it.</p>

                     <p>THe maide-seruant, who was the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the Ladie Margarete in all her iourney, and bore part of her labours and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and nowe was a comfort to her in seruing for an interpreter to vnderstand the language, will nowe forsake her. What will Archangell her sonne doe in this case? Will he hinder the good purpose of this Virgin to giue contentment to his mother? God forbid, that the loue of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be preferred before Gods ordination. Yea rather he encouraged the virgin to goe forward in her good purpose, and strengthned his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be obedient to the will of God, and of her maide-seruant in this case. Honourable is this forsaking of her Mistresse, to serue God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually among the holie sisters of S. Brigit, who were of so good fame at Teneramund. There she entred and liueth yet. In this we see her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse wholy resigned to the will of God for sweete Iesus sake, though sense and sensuall affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did much sway her to the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>This virgin as (I said before) was rather by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176965:277"/> education and out of ignorance an heretique, then by anie obliquitie and peruersenesse of will (for which cause her mistresse brought her out of Scotland) so that by the good instructions of Archangell, and conuersation of good people, she was so chaunged in a short time, that she ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the sect of Protestants, and receiued into the church (according to the custome) by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of baptisme, she proceeded euen to the top of true Christian perfection. I haue visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at conuenient times this religious virgin, with the leaue of my Superiour and mother Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse, and haue had conference of edification with her. I thought likewise and hoped not in vaine, that I might be informed of her in some matters to my purpose which either I knewe not, or had forgotten. Therefore when I came to the monasterie at Teneramund, after I had obtained leaue to speake with her, the vaile by a singular priuiledge was remoued, which couereth the windowe of the speaking place. As soone as she heard me, she remembred my voice, since that I had speech with her when she dwelt with her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Mistresse. When I told her that I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to write the historie of Archangels life, she and her religious sisters reioyced not a litle, who euer much honoured him being well knowne to him, and obtained by earnest entreatie his Cappucins Beades. Whereupon taking a litle time of respit, she recited to me all thinges in order verie shamfastlie and modestly, which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176965:277"/> I haue digested in their places, whereof some she had heard often repeated by her Lady and Mistresse, and some other she had seene with her owne eyes. When I heard this deliuered to me, I had in companie with me, father Adrian a Priest of Gant, who was a faithfull witnesse of this, and did helpe me afterward in remembring that which was related.</p>
                     <p>At my fare-well, I praid the Virgin, that she should endeuour to call to minde, if she did yet remember anie thing worthie to be noted concerning Archangell, whether it were done before he left his countrie, or since. She being also asked of me, whether she liued there content, hauing no acquaintance nor any freind to visit her, she answered she was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of the good companie of her religious sisters, and that all other companie was irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to her. For better assurance and credit of her relation, she alleaged a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse Maister Alexander Ciston a Scotish man, exiled for his religion, who had liued long in this countrie, and was able of his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to confirme all that she had said for a truth: With whom I haue had often and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious speech, concerninge this matter, and he did confidentlie auouch, that the life of Archangell was like the life of Saint Alexius in manie thinges, in forsakinge his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in his lacke of meate and drinke, in his destresses, labours, pouertie, nakednesse, trauaile
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:176965:278"/> to foraine countries, and especially in leauing his spouse.</p>
                     <p>I suppose nowe the reader doth long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, what became of his desolate spouse, and what course she taketh in the absence of her husband, and whiles he prayeth vncessantly for her, whether she be endued with light in her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and taketh courage accordingly. How gracious and mercifull is God! This mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den being espoused, or rather promised to Iohn Forbese, at thirteene yeares of age, was brought vp and strongly imbued from her infancie with heresie, yet not long time after folowinge the councell of her spouse, after that dolefull separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was conuerted to the Catholique faith, and secretely reconciled to the Catholique church, by the meanes of the foresaid deuout father of the societie of Iesus, and was strengthened and confirmed by the Sacraments of the church. O how often (her spouse being absent from her) did she commend her soule to Almightie God, to the Blessed Virgin, and St. Francis, praying that the corruption of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>O most sweete Iesus, louer of mankind, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and infuser of all chast and pure councell, heare the prayer of thy faithfull exiled seruant, and receiue graciously my humble petition. Let teares trickling downe my cheekes moue thee, let sight sighs from the bottome of my heart take place

Behold the voice of her spouse is heard in heauen, and she prayed for her selfe, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistinge in pious workes, and obeying her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structour.</p>
                     <p>It was decreed in the consistorie of the most Bl. Trinitie, that the beloued soule of this virgin, should leaue her chast bodie, and be taken from it by the ministerie of Angels, and to be rewarded with eternall blisse, on the dismall and prefixed day of the departure of her best beloued. Soe she ended her life after two yeares had passed, since her husbands forsaking of his countrie, whom within a few yeares after, Archangel and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will folow. In this short time of her conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Archangels spouse gained her sister, who abandoning her natiue soile, went to Rome, where as yet she liueth, giuing her selfe to Catholique deuotion, till it shall please God to call her to him, and ioyne her with this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed companie.</p>

In this truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the bountie &amp; goodnesse of our Sauiour: Wherefore not without cause was the voice of reioycing heard in the tabernacle of the iust, but specially in the tabernacle of the minde of the Ladie Margarete, who seeing these greate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of God in her two sonnes, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before mentioned, being nowe posessed of her desires, did begin with iust Simeon to sing. <hi>Lord now lett thy seruant depart in peace, because mine eyes haue seene thy saluation. I desire to be dissolued and to be with thee. Lett my combate be ended. I haue fought a good combate, I haue finis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed my course, I haue kept the faith.</hi> For now she began to be sicke, and verie grieuouslie in the iudgement of the Phisitians. Now therefore o God mightie Creatour, who doest giue life to mortall men, and takest it from them when thou wilt. Thou doest take that spirit againe which thou gauest. Thou doest take away their spiritt and they faile and returne into their dust, not that thou doest bring in corruption or death, of which (o fountaine of life) thou canst not be the authour, for God did not make death,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:176965:279"/> but thou leaftest mans bodie to his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which like water not kept within its ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, falleth vpon the earth and perisheth. For euen as a torch-light is nourished by the waxe of which it is made, if it be turned downeward, is presentlie extinguished, because the waxe melteth and wasteth away too fast not without crackling of the flames: Soe surely the creature is held in the hands of the Creatour, either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right that it may liue, or turned downe-ward that it may perish.</p>
                     <p>Now o most mightie Creatour, who hast sett the bound of euerie one which cannot be passed, if it be decreed by thee to put an end to the life of thy seruant Margarete, and a litle after to her son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes life, blessed be thy will which is holie, well pleasing, and perfect, which we beseech to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline in mercie to thy faithfull seruant Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete.

She wanteth (o Lord) the comfort of her only sonne, whom she followed at the first euen to Teneramund,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176965:280"/> not so much for her naturall motherly comfort, as spirituall food of her soule, both by good instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and by Sacramentall Confessions (her sonne hauing licēce to minister to her because she could not finde a Priest who vnderstood the Scotish tongue, neither could she speake Dutch.) But her sonne seeing that his mother was well aduanced in spirituall life, and hauing found an English Priest which liued at Antwerpe, of whom she might receiue the Sacrament of pennance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by litle and litle for her better perfection, to with-drawe himselfe from her, and at length dealt with her to goe to Antwerpe, that she might wholy want his presence, and learne to be content in enioying thee only o God.

I rest will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but one thing I will aske of God, that my beloued sonne Archangel, may be shortly with me, and may recouer the reward of his fidelitie, and his labours in the kingdome of heauen. I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176965:280"/> haue sent before mee my eldest sonne, who was a soldiour seruing vnder the banner of the Crosse in the Cappucins order of S. Francis, hauing obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned those heauenly rewards, and I desire my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be enterred by his bodie, which is to be glorified, and lieth nowe buried in Gaunt, in the church of the Cappucins. Doubt not, o pious Dame, but thy will shall be herein fulfilled: as it was.</p>
                     <p>It is euident by the testimonie of M. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Caston a Scotish man, that the Ladie Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete foretold the day of her death six weekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in these or the like wordes. O Alexander, my most faithfull friend and countriman, on such a day (which was the feast of the circumcision) I shall leaue this world and goe to God, my most pure beginning, whom I haue wished for, whom I haue loued, to whom though I haue done litle seruice, yet I haue loued with sincere affection. When the time of her departure drewe on, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander asked her, if she did desire that her sonne should be sent for to her from Teneramund (for there he was Superiour, and she lay sicke at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerpe) she answered, that she was willing to want her sonne, to the end that she might more purely and more inwardlie enioy God, without anie thing betweene God and her, and without anie impediment. This was a manifest signe of her sanctitie and perfection: but saith she. Require my sonne from me, as opportunitie serueth, to giue thankes to the most clement Princes for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176965:281"/> their charitie to me, and their pension which they procured me from the Catholique king.</p>
                     <p>Therefore after she had receiued the blessed Sacrament, and extreme vnction, her most pure spirit went to heauen. And because she was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to want that humane consolation, which she in motherly affection had by her sonne, I doubt not but by this abnegation, she receiued an hundred fold, according to the promise of our Sauiour, both in this life, in her body, and now in her soule. When fa. Archangell vnderstood this by faithfull messengers, he was so farre from being moued with sorrowe, or anie humane pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he rather gaue infinite thankes to God, that he had giuen her such courage, that she cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed others to admire her vertue, in this conflict which she had with death. It is the priuiledge of a spirituall man, that no accident whatsoeuer can make him sad, not death it selfe. For no aduersitie hurteth, where no iniquitie beareth sway.

For what will God denie to his faithfull seruant, who hath begged of him in the other life, that she might presently enioy thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? Wherupon I seeme to heare thy religious brethren, mourning and breaking into words of griefe and sorowe. Shall we (say they) be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of so deare and well deseruing a father, and most sweete Brother? Alas shall the order leese
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176965:282"/> such a stay and comfort? Shall the glorie of youth faile in the midst of his course? But thy beloued soule was pleasing to Christ, and was full of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the age of a wise person, is not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the number of yeares. It is a ioyfull thing to call to minde, how he did euerie where shine in example to his brethren, in singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitie, and maturitie of life and manners, which was tempered with a sweete grauitie, how pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, sobre, modest, and chast he was, and how sparing in his diet. For he being a rigid obseruer of monasticall discipline, had irreconcileable warre with bellie cheare, being most humble in all his wordes and actions.</p>
                     <p>For though he was exalted to the function of a Preacher, &amp; burdensome honour of a Superiour, euen while he was yong, yet did not these things (which often cause some swelling and tickling of pride in that age) any whit alter him, yea he was the same man, not leesing one inch of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer submisnesse, but rather kept that decencie befitting him, without anie outward staine: in so much that the ancient fathers of the order, much moued by his cariage, chose him for Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitour or one of the foure counsailours, who are ioyned with the Prouinciall for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the religious of the Prouince. In which place he behaued himselfe so, that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manie to hope that he should be Prouinciall in a short time, and a man worthie of that charge. Yea the verie reuerend Fa. Archangel of Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:176965:282"/> a most graue man, and one who had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued exceedingly well of our order, hauing beene manie yeares Procuratour generall for the order in the Court of Rome, as also Diffinitour in the generall Chapter, who moreouer was sent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missarie and generall Visitour, to manie Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on this side the Alpes and beyond, thought it verie expedient that he should be lent into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Britannie to preach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dult from the Sea Apostolique. This reuerend Father when he did visit the Prouinces of the Lowe-countries, had secretely determined this mission of Archangel, as the Reuerend Fa. Francis an Irish man borne, well knowne for his sufficiencie both in Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall and mystical diuinitie, lately generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missarie of the Prouince of Colen, who much respected our Archangel, told me. But God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to himselfe, preuented his mission into Britannie.</p>
                     <p>Here I may fitly shewe by occasion of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement to superioritie, that this was one of the greatest inward afflictions which he had, at least in his estimation, that he was promoted being yet yong to the dignitie of Priesthood, and afterward by vertue of obedience, to superioritie. Whereas these promotions and titles of honour were much contrarie to his humilitie, which was naturally inbred in him, and augmented by his owne industrie. For who doth not see by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discourse of his life, that he was truly poore
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176965:283"/> in spirit. Yet when as it is not lawfull to resist the secrete prouidence of God, and his Superiours ordinance, he did violently force himselfe, and executed diligently the charge vndertaken, and inwardly fought against those honours, which were outwardly giuen to him, which he had done a while before against the disesteeming and dispising of others. In both these combates he shewed himselfe verie dexterous, both in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and cheerefully accepting debasements, and in attributing those honours not done to him but to God, by making a vigorous and wise reflexion on the excellencie of God.</p>
                     <p>Both these vertues are hard to attaine, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more easie and pleasing to commaund, then to be commaunded, to enioyne pennance, than to take it, to be serued of others, then to serue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But fa. Archangel was otherwise minded wee haue seene him often when he was to forbid anie thing, or to commaund his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were subiect to him, exercising his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with wonderfull reuerence and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. For he did beseech the elder according to the counsel of St. Paul as fathers, where in he shewed the ingenuitie of his noble nature. But when monasticall discipline was to be obserued stricktly (for without exercise of sharpenesse the edge of it would growe blunt) he was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in himselfe when pennance was to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon others, then the delinquents or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, euer mixing and tempering the oile of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:176965:283"/> mercie with the wine of iustice. If a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> anie time anie great punishment were to be inflicted, he would take part of the pennance vpon himselfe, as though it were some great matter of gaine, and so did he heape vp to himselfe, greater merit by this newe way, wherein God directed him, I meane in this manner of exercising others, then he did before when he was exercised by others.</p>
                     <p>He was alwaies more willing to doe anie thing of labour with his owne hands, then to haue commaunded others to haue done it, if it had beene lawfull so to haue done. He was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the first and the last in the common exercises of his brethren, especially in those which were base and vile, and whatsoeuer he had done when he was a simple clerke, he did not forbeare to doe nowe. He was diligent in visiting the sicke, and comforting them most sweetly, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding verie affectionately, all necessaries for them. He was not wanting to doe base offices in sweeping and making cleane their chambers, and washing and emptying those vncleane vessels, which be vsefull for sicke persons. He seemed to haue that saying of St. Francis, deepely imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his mind, which he doth inculcate in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> rule. If a mother doth nourish and loue her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sonne, how much more ought one to loue and nourish his spirituall brother. If anie fall sick, the rest ought to serue him, as they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be serued in the like necessitie. So is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of pouertie mitigated by remembrance of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176965:284"/> mutuall brotherly loue, whereby they knowe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat they are to be cherished, and so taking cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage are content with aduersitie.</p>
                     <p>He kept nothing to himselfe; If anie had asked his garment, or his cloake of him by the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, he presently would strippe himselfe and giue it him as I haue seene, although the change were made to his losse. So in other matters, if he did perceiue that an other mans things were worse then his, he was readie (obseruing an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest decencie) to depriue himselfe of his for their benefit. Neither did this Euangelicall person, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the precept of Cato, Keepe thine owne. He sett his heart vpon nothing, he did abandon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, he did possesse all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he had a speciall care to bestowe vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what was in his power, choosing rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to giue, especially of spirituall gifts giuen by God to him, with which when he was richly furnished, there was none more meeke, more milde, more affable then he, so that anie way an other might be gained to Christ, or be holpen in anie honest and necessarie affaire.</p>
                     <p>Howe pure his hands were, and how full of good workes, how well they were softned with the oile of mercie, which were prepared euerie day to offer vp the holie and maiestical sacrifice to God the father for the quicke and the dead, how incessantly almost were they lifted to God, how laborious were they in profitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, constant in a true confidence, how well
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176965:284"/> enformed to intercede for those that are of the house-hold of faith. To conclude, they were so plentifully watered with celestiall dewe, that they did not only releiue him, but others. Hence was it, that he celebrated Masse with so great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of minde, and so reuerent outward deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was as it were suspended from him selfe in a holie kind of rauishment, and both heart and flesh did reioice in the liuing God. There was none which did not desire much to serue him when he was sacrificing, and to communicate at his hands, hoping that their dulnesse &amp; drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse could not but be wakened by his feruour and attention, and kindled or rather inflamed by his Colloquie with God, which was so pure and all on fire.</p>
                     <p>There was no small contentment to behold his angelicall countenance, his delicate bodie, wasted with long abstinence and fasting, which was nothing but skine and bones, and seemed to approach neare to a spirituall substance. He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was such a Priest as St. Gregorie requireth, that is a stone of salt, sett before beasts which they are to licke and to be fatned therby. He had so much care what he might say to euerie one, &amp; how he might admonish them, that whosoeuer kept companie with him, did profit much by him, and was seasoned with a feruour of eternall life, by the touching as it were of this salt.</p>

                     <p>WHosoeuer shall diligently consider with him selfe, shall finde that he was enriched with the seauenfold operation of the holie Ghost, or with the gifts thereof, by ascending all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and likewise with the eight beatitudes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. Augustine, and to haue attained other vertues in no small measure. And to begin with the gift of the feare of God (which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wisedome) how poore became he in spirit when he despised earthly things, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled vpon the pompe and glorie of the world? Yet this did not occasion anie swelling of pride, for he thought most b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sely of himselfe, and did cast himselfe downe profoundly in consideration of himselfe, which he esteemed as nothing. He did obey all for God, submitt himselfe to others, and continue in true humilitie, &amp; childlike feare.</p>
                     <p>For the gift of pietie, it is vaine now to repeate here how milde and meeke he was. For the gift of science his often trickling teares, his deepe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sights and groanes for the time lost, and the neglect of the most soueraigne good, may suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demostrate it to vs. For the gift of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, what force and violence did he not vse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himselfe, that he might withdrawe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176965:285"/> from those things, with which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by the pestilent sweetnesse of them; and likewise might resist couragiously all euill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and suggestions? To performe this the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he had the gift of counsell infused in him, from aboue, that he might helpe anie weaker then himselfe wherein he could if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire helpe in distresse of one stronger then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. So that he extending the bowells of mercie to euerie one, found mercie himselfe. And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained cleannesse of heart by his continuall good employments for himselfe and others (for idle men are for the most part vncleane) so that he was fitt to contemplate that soueraigne good, which can onlie be discerned by a pure and cleare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. And certainly there could not but the last gift of wisedome be infused of the holy Ghost into so pure an vnderstanding, to pacifie and moderate the whole man, and to make him the sonne of God, I meane in likenesse. And who durst speake this, vnlesse the naturall sonne of God had giuen this honour to the sonnes of men by his merits?</p>
                     <p>Archangel confirmed in this peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of minde, was able to sustaine all aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and persecutions for Christs sake and for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. O sauoury and sweete wisedome, how fewe know thee, how happie are they that tast it, and drinke out of it a sober drunkennesse! How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne are such men to the world, whose sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and true Christian conuersation no man easily
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176965:286"/> marketh? Hauing receiued this gift, he was sweete and gratious to all in his conuersation, readie to make himselfe common to all, not verie seuere but gentle, and ful of compassion towards al, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all thinges, not in distraction of anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but in the solid and true vnitie of charitie.</p>
                     <p>Christ loued this faithfull soldiour, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with vertue from aboue, as he was loued in this world of his Father, and so consequently sent him not to temporall ioyes, but to great combates, not to honours but to disgraces and contempts, not to rest but to labours, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but to bring forth much fruict in patience. So hauing disposed in his hart his scale of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he went from vertue to vertue, and sawe the God of Gods in Sion, in the most secrete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict of his minde, in the bottome of his soule, after a manner not knowne to all. Rise here and be enlightned o Hierusalem, I say o deuout sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, because the glorie of our Lord is risen vpon thee, and thou art brought euen to behold his Highnesse, stearing thee with the light, thou art rapt into the louely and infinite abisse of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and brought into a most cleare knowledge of thy owne nothing. True peace and true ioye, are ministred vnto thee, and the fire of feruent prayer inflaming the temple of thy soule, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thy forces and faculties to it, that thou maiest there adore God in spirit and truth. Let the mist of earthly considerations be farre hence, and the smoke of worldlie wisedome. Therefore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176965:286"/> praise and glorie be to thee (o wisedome of the father) because thou hast multiplied these thy gifts in this religious brother, for all things are gouerned by thy wisedome.</p>
                     <p>Since now we haue seene thee (o Archangel) so richly furnished with the gifts of the holie Ghost, we will nowe see how well that precious golden chaine of vertues which St. Peter made, doth become thee, that of these radiant and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rings set together, thou maiest be adorned as it were with a regall present. For who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it to be due to thee, when thou hast valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ringed and hemmed in them all the powers of thy soule, and hast laboured to subdue inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate passions in thy neighbours, &amp; in thy charge committed to thee, not only administred words, as ministers of words were wont to doe, neither hast shewed a faith destitute of workes and other vertues, but as a Christian Catholique in name and deed, hast ministred in faith vertue, in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue knowledge, in knowledge abstinence, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence patience, in patience pietie, in pietie loue of brotherly fellowship, in loue of brotherly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship charitie, with all which vertues being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, thou canst not be called blind nor feeling with the hand (thy way) but that thou being girt with vertue, treading the right path, thou hast ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the place of heauenly rest.</p>
                     <p>And thou (o S. Peter) hauing beene bound with those dreadfull chaines in Iudea, wherein thou wast kept till death, hast well deserued to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176965:287"/> make this glorious chaine for the benefit of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie. Obtaine o Bl. Apostle by thy prayers hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe from aboue, that we may be girt and adorned with it. This thy doctrine hath a sweete sound, but it is sharpe to the Lukewarme, who forgett their old offences, the weight whereof, as it were chaining cordes, doth pull them downe into the pitt of hell. But our most wise and iust Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, hauing folowed thy wholsome doctrine, when he shall behold thee a neare assessour of the great iudge, and weare this inestimable chaine, he certainely shall haue thy hand to helpe him, and to drawe him to the glorie of heauen, where he shall securely triumph.</p>
                     <p>This chaine (o my brother) worne about thy necke, made of such radiant precious stones of vertues, doth now send forth a great lustre into the eyes of the beholders, which we doe deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reuerence, when as thou doest offer it to vs to be imbraced with a holy imitation. Therefore thou art blessed and shalt be foreuer, who hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued more of God, then thou couldst aske or hope for; Honour and glorie be to him, of whom being most mightie and strong, thou hast beene so sweetly fostered in great preuenting grace, as also subsequent, that thou grewest to that strength that thou didst not seeme to trangresse one title or yot of the rule of St. Francis, obseruinge it wholy both in formall precepts &amp; equipollents, in all the holesome admonitions and sweete ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of it: yea he obserued the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176965:287"/> of the order, and diuers ordinances of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, made according as occasion of time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as exactly as human frailtie can doe, with most rigorous endeauours, and euer respected them with all filiall reuerence.</p>
                     <p>No man can hardly performe these things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he be able to sing with the spouse in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to the eares of her beloued. <hi>His left hand is vnder my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.</hi> His left hand is vnder the head of the spouse, least the feruour of faith growe lukewarme in her. Farre be it, that she hurt it, but as a subtill and warie serpent, keepe the head of his faith safe and sound. But his right hand embraceth his spouse, that she doth not only keepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and lawes of God, but also endeauoureth to execute the Counsels of supererogatiōs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her vowe, not without much inward reioycing and exultation of spirit, and so reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to offer her selfe, a liuing and pleasing sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, in all reasonable seruices. The left hand is vnder the head of the spouse in time of tribulation, and the right hand cherishing her in time of consolation. By enterchange of both Fa. Archangel knewe what is the holie pleasing and perfect will of God, by which experience he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in some manner perfect, and not a litle practised in spirituall life, and conuersant in the mysticall practise of it. Praise and thankes be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the infinite power of God, who chose this his seruant, and made him conformable to

He was therfore sent to preach to these soldiours, armed with the merit of obedience, and the loue of the common good, and in a short time by the sweete word of God, by his holesome doctrine, and especially by his singular example of life, and mature and discreet cariage, he wonne a whole band of more then three hundred, and brought them to the Catholique faith, not all at once, but by litle and litle, in perswading nowe one, now
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176965:289"/> an other: besides about eighteene of his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he gained at Mennen in the same iourney. When he had wonne them to be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, he kept them in that discipline at Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund by the authoritie of his nobilitie, and sharpe reprehension of the offendours, that all the citizens and neighbours of that place, did much wonder at them, and were exceeding loath to be depriued of so well ordered and well beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued soldiours. So he restored lost sight to the blind, wandering from the way of truth, or if they neuer had sight, he prepared and quickned their sights to them wherewith Christ is seene.</p>
                     <p>He appeased a sedition which rose among the Spanish and Scotish soldiours, which were in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. For whiles he attended in the beginning to the gaining of the soules of his countriemen, he heard a soldiour crie, and a great alarum: and hastning to see what it should be, he found both sides readie to enter combate one with an other. There was nothing wanting but the signe which was to be giuen by the Captaines on both sides, which when he sawe, he cast himselfe into the midst on his knees, his armes stretched in the manner of a Crosse, and together with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion praying and exhorting them to peace, speaking sometimes sweetly to them, someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes terrifying them, one while in his mother tongue, an other while in the french tongue. At last he preuailed so much with them, that they forbore this bloudie combate, which they were
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176965:289"/> euen entring into, and became quiet. The citizens besought to stay the Cappucins, that they should not put themselues into so manifest daunger, but the loue of God and our neighbour is held by no hands. For this act of exceeding charitie, the Prince, and also the Gouernour of the Westerne part of Flaunders, who was called Count Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric van den Berg, gaue great thankes to fa. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel and to God, for the benefit obtained by him. Whereupon Archangel obtained that grace of the Prince, that he pardoned at his earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the chiefe authours of this commotion, who were to haue beene punished with death for so great an offence. Brother Adam of Lisle, who was still in companie of fa. Archangel in this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, auowed in the presence of his Superiour, all this to haue beene done by Archangel. He testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied also, that the Minorits, who were at Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund at that time, who entertained fa. Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in their Conuent, did so respect and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him, that they were wholy guided and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by him, perceiuing (as they related them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) that the presence of the holie ghost did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, and most euidently manifest it selfe in all his actions.</p>
                     <p>No citizen or soldiour at Dixmund, could euer obtaine so much of him, as to come to their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though they were neuer so importune, nor the Gouernour himselfe. But he was euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one meale a day, and that a small one, seeking quiet retraict, and studying for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176965:290"/> recouerie of poore misbelieuing soules: And his strict fasting, did afford him time to pray &amp; studie.</p>
                     <p>The Gardian of that place, a wise and learned man, did say (as it were diuining) that Archangel would not liue long, but that God would spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily render him the reward of his labours and trauailes. At midnight while he was at his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed prayers and deuotions, he seemeth to heare with the eare of his soule, that he was thus admonished by holie instinct. O fa. Guardian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Francis for their head, prepare for thy meeting, to the end that they may ioyfully receiue an exiled of Christ, &amp; bring a souldiour of Christ, to the throne of his happie countrie and eternall seate.</p>
                     <p>Hauing therefore atchieued this noble worke, and hauing gotten the victorie against the enemie of mankind, he returned from Dixmund (reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing much in spirit) to his owne Conuent, being most welcome to them and expected. But by the diuine prouidence so disposing it, he went a litle after to Waestmunter, scarce two leagues from Teneramund, to doe some seruice to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that place, according to their request. Where whē as the infectious sicknesse did raigne,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176965:290"/> which disease our countrimen cal the gift of God (because it is sent by the singular prouidence of God) and God would not that this his seruant should be without this gift, that the wicked may see when the scourge approacheth to the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the iust, how iustly they are to feare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and to returne by doing penance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the Prophete Hieremy saith. <hi>Behold they whose iudgment was not to drinke the cup, drinking shall drinke, and shalt thou be left innocent?</hi> Thou shalt not be innocent, but drinking shalt drinke. And is there such a scourge in the house of God for the iust? For the Pagans did vpbraid this to Christians, and seemed to insult with peeuish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes ouer them, when the faithfull Prelates said, that God did scourge and plague their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for the effusion of Christian bloud, and that they felt banishment inflicted vpon them more cruell then death. Were there anie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiās (said they) which were exempted more then Gentils from raging tempests, from plague, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and such calamities?</p>
                     <p>Pontius Diaconus doth make St. Ciprian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently replying to them. Some are troubled that we haue the same mortalitie as others, but what is there in this world, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to vs with others, as long as wee are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the same flesh with them, according to the lawe of our first natiuitie? yea if a Christian doe well vnderstand and knowe, vpon what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or lawe he is to beleiue, he is to knowe, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176965:291"/> he must endure more in this world then others, whereas he is to haue a greater combate with the tentation of the Deuill. But what disparitie there is, betweene those scourges, which seeme equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to befal both, in the iudgement of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, he declareth afterward, saying. Manie of ours die in this mortalitie, that is leaue this world, but this mortalitie as it is a plague to the Iewes and Gentiles, so is it a healthfull and happie departure for the seruants of God. Therefore in his Inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue against Demetrius the Proconsul, St. Cyprian doth vse manie golden sentences, seruing to this purpose, which I could wish I and others could call to minde in time of affliction. Among other things he saith. They haue noe grief or sorrowe for present miseries, who haue a strong confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of hauing future happinesse. Finally, saith he; we are neither disamaied nor discouraged, neither doe we murmure in anie calamitie or afflictions of our bodies, and liuing alwaies rather in spirit then in flesh, we doe ouercome the infirmitie of the bodie, with firmitie and strength of soule. And doe ye thinke that we doe suffer affliction equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with you, when yee see wee sustaine it farre otherwise? Yee are transported with crying and cōplaining by impatience, and we put on a noble and religious patience, which is quiet and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the presence of God. For the rest I referre the Reader to the authour.</p>
                     <p>This good fa. finding at his returne an vnusuall burning heate of his bodie, began to growe hot
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176965:291"/> in his soule, longing after his beloued sweete Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Hauing recouered his Conuent he called his sonnes to him, and after a louing exhortation, and a benediction of a farewell bestowed vpon them, in fewe words by reason of death approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, he tooke the Sacraments with ioye and exultation. Why should he feare to die, who lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die so often, when his feete were now standing in the gates of Hierusalem passing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly by the gates of death, by which there was a pleasant entrie into the supping place or parlour of Hierusalem? His brethren see him in a hott burning fit of a feuer, and his strength and his speech failed him. The Phisitians vpon good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and likewise at the instance of the sicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, counsel him to be remoued to a backe house, which was a good distance from the Conuent, to preuent danger of infection. How manie wayes, and in how diuers manners, is a true Christian exercised of God in this life, that being afflicted in fewe things, he may be well disposed in manie things, that God may find him worthie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? But what are the sufferings of this life, in respect of the glorie to come, which our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God sendeth to his elect, out of his infinite loue, that he doth (that I may so speake) often bethinke himselfe, whether he shall lay this or that crosse, vpon this or that man, and so in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner feareth, least so precious a present be neglected, or the Crosse which is of such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, be shaken off from our lasie shoulders Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176965:292"/> Archangel hauing a true feeling hereof, was readie euen to the brinke of old decaying age, to suffer humbly and cheerefully with Iesus, which prompt will and affection of his, without doubt shall haue the recompense &amp; reward due vnto it.</p>

                     <p>THe king of heauen tooke the deare soule of his pilgrim to him, as his feeble bodie was nowe carried in the midst of the garden, vpon the bridge which is ouer the brooke. O happie soule, goe thou out of thy earthly garden of the Cappucins, to the pleasant gardens of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Paradice! And thou which left vs vpon the brooke, be thou absorpt vp in the immense floud of the Diuinitie? Thou which on earth wast tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled with manie conflicts, by meanes wherof thou wast free from the bodily desires, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed in the palace of thy minde, to attend only to diuine wisedome, but now hauing attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a place silent from all earthly cares, reioyce and triumph in the contemplation of the Deitie, and in eternall delights! In not vnlike manner, and euen by the same disease, did God call the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued soule of St. Lewes king of France to him, who died in a strange land. He also embraced him taking him out of his armie, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped against the enemie: Sweete was this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176965:292"/> and the gift of this disease was worthie to be embraced. He that can conceiue this, let him conceiue.</p>
                     <p>Those that loue God, and haue tasted the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Crosse, vnderstand well what I speake. O infinite treasure and benefit of anie tribulation suffered for Christ! O gaine knowne to fewe, and sweete to fewe! Heare S. Andrewe crying. Suffer me nor o Lord to be taken downe from the Crosse, by the wicked iudge, because I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the vertue of the holie Crosse. Will ye I expresse my selfe in one word? If our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel had raised a hundred dead, if he had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all sicke persons of his time, I should not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme all this to be valued with his labours and trauailes from his youth, which I haue declared to you. If you will not beleiue me, beleiue Saint Chrysostome saying. To suffer for Christ, is a gift of greater admiration, then to raise the dead, and to worke miracles: For doing these I am a debtour to Christ, but in the other I haue Christ my debtour. Therefore we are to thanke God much for our brother Archangel, who was so stout and faithfull in sustaining the Crosse of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. The weight of glorie which he hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is greater then can be valued. For if a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and iust maister of a familie, be carefull to giue his labourer his hire, in the euening when he resteth from worke, how much more wil the heuenly master and father, be careful to performe his promise to his seruant? Reioyce in the Lord
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:176965:293"/> o ye iust, make your dayes of festiuitye with him, and thou Sonne with thy mother, thinke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of vs, and of the Senate and people of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe and Teneramund, where thou didst end thy dayes, who harboured and fauored thee being an exiled person, and likewise thy deare mother.</p>
                     <p>This religious man Archangel, was buried in the yeare 1606. in the 26. yeare of his age, in the bodie of the Cappucins church at Teneramund, neare to the holie water vessel. After he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the common burying place of the other brethren, who resteth sweetly in our Lord, held manfully the sterne of faith, now hath fixed his anchour of hope in a safe roade, and hath placed his ship laden with rich merchandise, in the long wished for hauen. It is a thinge not vnworthie the obseruation, that the father and mother of Archangel, and he himselfe, dyed the same yeare 1606. one after an other, who did all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their reward, according to their workes: the mother and the sonne, both iust and full of constancie shall stand vp in the last day, against those who were the first mouers and causers of their affliction.</p>
                     <p>His cruell father, when he heard that his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife was dead, he could not refraine to weepe and say. O faithfull, and thrice faithfull wise! O my deare Margarit, art thou departed this life after so manie distresses and trauells? He died a litle after (which is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:176965:293"/> impenitent for his life past.</p>
                     <p>Some fewe dayes before Archangel died, the Reuerend father Michael of Arimini, was sent as Commissarie to these parts of the Lowe-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to visite the Prouinces of the Cappucins, situate on this side the Alpes; who when he heard of the death of this most deuout father, he shed manie teares, lamenting much his death, though he scarce knewe him, but by the sweete odour of a good fame and reputation: and so manie others were excessiuelie sorrie, out of much loue and compassion of the Prouince, which had such a losse, yea the remembrance of his life past, and his amiable conuersation tempered with such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, did moue all that knewe him to moane his decease. I doe repeate againe his humilitie, because he was so humble that he would scarce speake in his owne cause, so humble that he was neuer heard to speake an idle word among his brethren, so fearefull least he should commit anie thing against the commandements of God and his Sauiour: and not only the commandements, but the counsailes of Euangelicall perfection, that he did offer dayly manie deaths of his flesh and sensualitie, as an acceptable sacrifice, sacrificing himselfe vpon the straite and sharpe altar of true abnegation, fulfilling the word of our Sauiour. <hi>Vnlesse the graine of wheate falling into the ground dye, it selfe remaineth alone, but if it die, it bringeth much fruict.</hi> Againe, <hi>if anie man will come after me, let him denie him selfe.</hi> May not I therefore cal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176965:294"/> Archangel a Martyr, who chose to dye so often in himselfe for Christ? Moreouer, I may call the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease by which he ended his life, a kind of shining martyrdome by fire, which he ouercame by the fire of diuine charitie kindled in him.</p>
                     <p>O graine perfectly dead to the world, and to it selfe! o pure graine accordinge to the minde of our Sauiour, which remained not alone in the earth, but brought forth much fruict. Who may not see, that he was a chosen graine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, although it were couered with a litle chaffe, and rough with the eare of the corne, to witt, not as yet so purged from secular desires, till he was fourteene yeares of age? But by Gods mercie protecting him, this graine was not tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon and broken or brused, because it was purged and cleansed seauenfold by most apt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. How pure a graine also his mother was, ye doe well remember, alwaies fresh and vigourous, also whole and sound, in prosperitie and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, together with her noble brethren, Princes who are to be renowned to posteritie: sauing one only whom we haue heard forsooke the faith, not without great mourning of his freinds and kinsmen, and the domage of Catholiques. And how came it to passe, but because he did not shunne outwardly the companie of bad persons, &amp; was not so fearefull of this plague as he should haue beene. <hi>Blessed is the man</hi> (saith the scripture) <hi>who is alwaies fearefull.</hi> It is therefore mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by this discourse, that the graines of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176965:294"/> are so sweetly disposed of by the mercie of God, that the vnfruictfull cockle doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their fruict.</p>
                     <p>I wil not omitt in this place, the loue and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a certaine religious Priest, who was subiect to him in the Cōuent, who bore in his armes this fa. Archangel when he gaue vp the ghost, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe a louing and faithfull brother, that he would doe him this seruice, which was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with such danger of death, by reason of the contagion. He folowed him shortly after into an other life. His name was Michael of Louaine, of the familie of Wachelgē. He being the only heire, for Christs sake left his mother a widowe who is yet liuing, and hath offered this pledge of hers to God for sacrifice, and to her selfe for a renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. God exercised this religious man Michael, with much sicknesse, and it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible not without signe of his loue. He was of a liuely and quicke witt and nature, and God will purge him in this manner from earthly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was well exercised in spirituall direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hauing performed well the office of the master of the Nouices. He ouercame all indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of bodie, by the vertue and courage of his minde.</p>
                     <p>A mutuall loue also made one that was newly professed, Simplician the sonne of a citizen of Antwerpe, to assist Archangel in his sicknesse, who was simple in name &amp; deed, who died with a cheareful countenance reioycing alwaies in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:176965:295"/> There assisted him also with much affection, though his strength did not serue him, Nicasius who was of the familie of Vrebde, well knowne in these countries, who continued to the end a faithfull lay brother and humble seruant, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing almes and doing the seruices belonging to him. There was also a religious Priest a French man by nation, of most sweete behauiour, who ended his life by helping him. So while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated one an other, one drewe on the other as it were by the hand to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. So God who visited his familie, would not take him away without companie, and in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence he sent two religious Cappucins Priests, who in obedience to their Superiours volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vndertooke the care of the sicke. So we see truly what it is, to lay downe our liues for our brethren: for it please God, to preserue these two and the rest, all safe and sound.</p>
                     <p>The Prophete Dauid did mourne for his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sonne, slaine in an vnhappie battaile, saying. <hi>O my brother Ionatha, I mourne for thee.</hi> Which dolefull speech, I may vse for thee (o brother Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel) since we are depriued of thy so sweete and profitable conuersation and amitie. Who can not but desire thy gratefull presence, thy sweete and holesome conferences, yet alwayes seasoned with salt? who doth not wish to haue the light of thy edification, and thy wise and graue actions, to shine alwayes before him? Who would not be excited a fresh with the eminent
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176965:295"/> vertues of thy patience and constance? O how soone hath God hastened, to drawe thee out of the allurements of this world, and the midst of the iniquities thereof? It was not needfull to prouoke thee to please him, for thy soule was pleasing to him. Therefore what hath pleased God, let it please vs also. In the meane while, deare brother, sing ioifully with iubilation to God, ioyned in quire with thy mother. Sing (I say) that of the Apostle. <hi>As the sufferings of Christ abounded in vs, so doth now our consolation abound by Christ.</hi> I meane those sufferings which haue beene laid, not only vpon thee, but vpon all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques in the kingdome of Scotland, and the rest of the Isles of Britannie, and almost through all those westerne parts. In the midst of which thou stoodest so much the more stout, because thou wert farther off from iniquitie. It is only iniquitie which separateth vs from God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity which doth most straictly ioyne vs to him. The example of the great Prophete Moyses, doth witnesse this, who chose rather to be afflicted with the people of God, then to haue the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of temporall sinne, esteeming the reproche of Christ to be greater riches, then the treasure of the Aegyptians, for he looked to the finall reward.</p>
                     <p>Blessed be thy name (o sweet Iesus) for those whom thou hast caused to be borne in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie age, wherein they haue seene the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their nation, in which thy faithfull haue
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:176965:296"/> beene truly tryed, as we hope for their correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not to perdition. What harme haue these now who are so departed, who were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to haue suffered more if they had happened? Nowe are the teares wiped from your eyes, now doth the grief continue no longer, there is no crie nor mourning in your streetes. Behold God hath made all newe. Reioyce therefore (o Archangel) in our Lord, for he hath giuen thee the desires of thine owne heart.</p>
                     <p>But some will say, it is meruaile if this mans life hath beene so vertuous, that God hath not permitted him to shine with some miracles? We answere, this is not necessarie to the sanctitie of anie man. Miracles are done whensoeuer, and by whom it shall please God, to whom it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to worke miracles. If at anie time they be necessarie, they are not for that end as though they were anie part of sanctitie, but they serue for testimonie to those, who either doubt of the sanctitie of anie Sainct, or to whom God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale that sanctitie. But it is euident, that Gods will is not that manie Saincts should be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to the world, that he may honour them more in heauen, by how much they are lesse honoured on earth. Moreoue, they whose holie life is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently knowne by good workes, need not the proofe of miraculous signes. So we reade in the Gospel, that Iohn Baptist, the forerunner of our Sauiour, did no miracle: likewise we reade of S. Lyduma a virgin of Schiedam, yea in the golden
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:176965:296"/> and fresh flourishing age of St. Francis, we doe finde diuerse eminent for sanctitie, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for contemplation of diuine things, who did not shine with this light of miracles, as may appeare by the Chronicles which treate of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the first twelue disciples of S. Francis.</p>
                     <p>We doe not reade of anie miracles that were done by Bl. S. Egidius, who fell often into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies and rauishments of spirit, whom when the Pope that then was, found in such an extasie that he could not be awaked, neither with sharpe prickings, nor applying hot fire to his bodie, being commaunded by the vertue of holie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to returne againe to himselfe (by way of prophecying) he said. Yee shall haue no signe of me, but the signe of Ionas: which words when no man vnderstood, they who digged his graue vnderstood afterward, for in digging they found a marble sepulchre, in which the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of Ionas was artificially engrauen.</p>
                     <p>We reade in our Chronicles in the time of Saint Francis, that a certaine Guardian called brother Peter, did manie miracles after his death. To whom Saint Francis comming to his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, spake in this manner. My sonne and brother Peter, thou hast alwayes beene obedient to me when thou didst liue, be now also obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to me after thy death. I commaund thee by holie obedience, that thou cease from doing miracles, that the Brethren of this Conuent may be quiet and free from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176965:297"/> of people, and serue God in more si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and spirituall retraict. The sonne obeyed his father presently, and the miracles ceased. The institute of the Seraphicall father hath now beene approued by manie ages, and by the chiefe Bishops who haue declared it to be truly euangelicall, and witnessed by manie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous persons, both for sanctitie and glorie of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and therefore it needeth no more proofes, although by Gods holie disposition, there want not manie miracles, both to the church and to our order in particular. The Collection of which is happily to come forth verie shortly to the view of the world.</p>
                     <p>I thought therefore it was not expedient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in these, but to prosecute my purpose in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing plaine testimonies of Sanctitie. But those signes are, to suffer willingly tribulations for Christs sake, of which the Apostle doth someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes glorie. Yea, God would haue him to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this signe, that he was a vessel of election. For when Ananias thought verie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l of Saint Paul, and that not without iust cause, neither durst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neare to him, Goe saith Christ to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, for a vessel of election is this man to me to carie my name before the Gentils and kings, and the children of Israel, and I will shewe him how great things he must suffer for my name. Hereby doth our charitie most appeare. Not miracles, but only charitie makes the seruantes God, as S. Augustine speaketh well vpon Saint Iohn. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176965:297"/> Saint Paul saith, that all other things profit vs nothing without charitie, no not faith which can remoue mountaines, no not to speake with the tongues of Angels, nor the distribution of all our goods to the poore, all which though the Apostle supposeth may be without charitie, yet doth he after prooue himselfe the seruant of God, by those sufferings which he had patiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for Christs sake.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I say, that where it is euident, that anie man hath liued according to the precept of the holie Gospell, in an approued religion as ours is, certainly he needeth not miracles to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his sanctitie, because he hath an other sufficient kind of proofe of his sanctitie. The Iurists say, where the intention of the partie is sufficiently knowne one way, it should be superfluous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire other proofes: For there is more saffe and sure credit to be giuen, to the election of anie man or to his sanctitie by this fore-said kind of proofe, then if it were founded in miracles. For the word of Christ is sufficient for the testimonie of their sanctitie, who saith. <hi>Ye are my friends.</hi> Againe, <hi>ye that haue left all and folowed me.</hi> There is no man which can iustly doubt, whether Archangel were an euangelicall man in his life, after his conuersion. The greatest miracle that is, is to see a man daily stand without intermission ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him selfe. In doing miracles, man is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to God, but in victorie of himselfe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abnegation, he hath God his debtour, if we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:176965:298"/> belieue Saint Chrisostome. The life of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, is a continuall miracles of an vnbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die martyrdome. Therefore I hope my labour well bestowed, in setting forth the life of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie person, that I may take delight to imitate him, whom I haue with much affection so cōmended.</p>
                     <p>Neither let it seeme strange, that I a Lowe-countrie man, doe so celebrate a Scotish man, principally him which hath for Gods cause for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken his countrie, and chose this from his yong yeares. For in this countrie he hath shined to the world, in education, conuersation, state of life and death, he hath shined (I say like) a most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant precious stone, he hath flourished like a sweete ruddie rose, and insteed of a most sauorous seasoning, he hath refreshed the mindes of men with his honie flowing discourses, and yeelded an odour like a white lilie. In which respect I may rather call him a Lowe-countrie man, or a Flemming, then a Scotish man, who also coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed his mother to abandon Scotland, depraued with heresie, and to retire herselfe into Flaunders, where she and her eldest sonne also ended their liues. So we reade of Saint Iodocus the sonne of a king of Brittanie and Scotland, who came into these parts with his sister, and liued most holily, and here ended his life. He was not afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for a Scotish man, but for one of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honoured in our prayers: after whom manie were called by the name of Iodocus. Who knoweth whether this Archangel be not descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:176965:298"/> from this holie person, especially by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, by reason of the royall stemme of the Stuarts, to which he is ioyned?</p>
                     <p>Wherefore not I, but all the orthodoxe socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Britannes, and the congregation of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins of this Countrie, ought iustly to shewe deuotion in powring forth their prayers and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes in honour of this blessed soule, saying. God be with thee most sweete Archangel. O newe light of noble Brabant, foster child of the noble citie of Antwerpe, ornament of the Lowe-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, honour of Flaunders, bright shining starre of Scotland! o fragant and sweete plant of the Cappucins, out of which yong buds doe yet sproute! o fruictfull tree, which hath brought forth pleasant fruict, contayning in it the most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely aple of so vigorous a seede; O goodly struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which being raised vpon a lowe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation, doth touch the roofe of heauen! Blessed be thy entrie into the land of the liuing. Blessed be thy labours, and the examples of light which thou hast shewed to vs. God graunt we may merit to folow them, and thee in them, and so consequently see thee shining as a glorious bright starre to all eternitie.</p>
                     <p>I vnworthie and poore Priest, which write this, sawe much of this with mine eyes, and as it were touched them with my hands, being so euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie palpable. Some things I had of my brothers, who are true witnesses and relatours of that which they knowe, and some fewe things of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176965:299"/> of good credit: so that there is no doubt of the whole storie. Yet notwithstanding for the better confirmation of truth, by the manie testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of diuers religious Priests and brethren, sent to Rome by the commandement of our verie R. Father Generall, I thought good to set downe one or two. The first was, of the verie Reuerend Father Cornelius of Recantum, in these words. I doe ratifie the wonderfull conuersion, and not only laudable, but eminent conuersation of R. F. Archangel a Scotishman, and the yonger Cappu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin, of which I haue beene informed by witnesses beyond exception, and sawe manie things with mine owne eyes: so that for a certaine space of time, his most exemplarie life was well knowne to vs. Fr. Cornelius of Recant.</p>
